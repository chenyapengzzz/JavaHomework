Whenever you feel like criticizing any one  he told me just remember that all the people in this world haven t hadthe advantages that you ve had
He didn t say any more but we ve always been unusuallycommunicative in a reserved way and I understood that hemeant a great deal more than that In consequence I m in-clined to reserve all judgments a habit that has opened upmany curious natures to me and also made me the victimof not a few veteran bores Te abnormal mind is quick todetect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in anormal person and so it came about that in college I wasunjustly accused of being a politician because I was privyto the secret griefs of wild unknown men Most of the con-fdences were unsought frequently I have feigned sleeppreoccupation or a hostile levity when I realized by someunmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quiver-ing on the horizon for the intimate revelations of youngmen or at least the terms in which they express them areusually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressionsReserving judgments is a matter of infnite hope I am stilla little afraid of missing something if I forget that as my fa-Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    ther snobbishly suggested and I snobbishly repeat a senseof the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally atbirth
And afer boasting this way of my tolerance I come tothe admission that it has a limit Conduct may be foundedon the hard rock or the wet marshes but afer a certain pointI don t care what it s founded on When I came back fromthe East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be inuniform and at a sort of moral attention forever I want-ed no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpsesinto the human heart Only Gatsby the man who gives hisname to this book was exempt from my reaction Gatsbywho represented everything for which I have an unafect-ed scorn If personality is an unbroken series of successfulgestures then there was something gorgeous about himsome heightened sensitivity to the promises of life as if hewere related to one of those intricate machines that registerearthquakes ten thousand miles away Tis responsivenesshad nothing to do with that fabby impressionability whichis dignifed under the name of the  creative temperament  it was an extraordinary gif for hope a romantic readinesssuch as I have never found in any other person and whichit is not likely I shall ever fnd again No Gatsby turnedout all right at the end it is what preyed on Gatsby whatfoul dust foated in the wake of his dreams that temporarilyclosed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men
My family have been prominent well-to-do people inthis middle-western city for three generations Te Car-    The Great Gatsbyraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition thatwe re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch but the ac-tual founder of my line was my grandfather s brother whocame here in ffy-one sent a substitute to the Civil War andstarted the wholesale hardware business that my father car-ries on today
I never saw this great-uncle but I m supposed to looklike him with special reference to the rather hard-boiledpainting that hangs in Father s ofce I graduated from NewHaven in 1915 just a quarter of a century afer my fatherand a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic mi-gration known as the Great War I enjoyed the counter-raidso thoroughly that I came back restless Instead of being thewarm center of the world the middle-west now seemed likethe ragged edge of the universe so I decided to go east andlearn the bond business Everybody I knew was in the bondbusiness so I supposed it could support one more singleman All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they werechoosing a prep-school for me and fnally said  Why ye-es  with very grave hesitant faces Father agreed to fnanceme for a year and afer various delays I came east perma-nently I thought in the spring of twenty-two
Te practical thing was to fnd rooms in the city but it wasa warm season and I had just lef a country of wide lawnsand friendly trees so when a young man at the ofce sug-gested that we take a house together in a commuting townit sounded like a great idea He found the house a weatherbeaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month but at thelast minute the frm ordered him to Washington and I wentFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    out to the country alone I had a dog at least I had him for afew days until he ran away and an old Dodge and a Finnishwoman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and mut-tered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stoveIt was lonely for a day or so until one morning some manmore recently arrived than I stopped me on the road How do you get to West Egg village  he asked helpless-ly
I told him And as I walked on I was lonely no longer Iwas a guide a pathfnder an original settler He had casu-ally conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhoodAnd so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leavesgrowing on the trees just as things grow in fast movies Ihad that familiar conviction that life was beginning overagain with the summer
Tere was so much to read for one thing and so muchfne health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giv-ing air I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit andinvestment securities and they stood on my shelf in red andgold like new money from the mint promising to unfoldthe shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Mae-cenas knew And I had the high intention of reading manyother books besides I was rather literary in college oneyear I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorialsfor the  Yale News  and now I was going to bring back allsuch things into my life and become again that most limitedof all specialists the  well-rounded man  Tis isn t just anepigram life is much more successfully looked at from asingle window afer all
The Great Gatsby  It was a matter of chance that I should have rented ahouse in one of the strangest communities in North Ameri-ca It was on that slender riotous island which extends itselfdue east of New York and where there are among othernatural curiosities two unusual formations of land Twentymiles from the city a pair of enormous eggs identical incontour and separated only by a courtesy bay jut out intothe most domesticated body of salt water in the WesternHemisphere the great wet barnyard of Long Island SoundTey are not perfect ovals like the egg in the Columbusstory they are both crushed fat at the contact end buttheir physical resemblance must be a source of perpetualconfusion to the gulls that fy overhead To the wingless amore arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in everyparticular except shape and size
I lived at West Egg the well the less fashionable of thetwo though this is a most superfcial tag to express the bi-zarre and not a little sinister contrast between them Myhouse was at the very tip of the egg only ffy yards from theSound and squeezed between two huge places that rentedfor twelve or ffeen thousand a season Te one on my rightwas a colossal afair by any standard it was a factual imi-tation of some Htel de Ville in Normandy with a tower onone side spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy and amarble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawnand garden It was Gatsby s mansion Or rather as I didn tknow Mr Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentle-man of that name My own house was an eye-sore but itwas a small eye-sore and it had been overlooked so I had aFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    view of the water a partial view of my neighbor s lawn andthe consoling proximity of millionaires all for eighty dol-lars a month
Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionableEast Egg glittered along the water and the history of thesummer really begins on the evening I drove over there tohave dinner with the Tom Buchanans Daisy was my secondcousin once removed and I d known Tom in college Andjust afer the war I spent two days with them in ChicagoHer husband among various physical accomplishmentshad been one of the most powerful ends that ever playedfootball at New Haven a national fgure in a way one ofthose men who reach such an acute limited excellence attwenty-one that everything aferward savors of anti-cli-max His family were enormously wealthy even in collegehis freedom with money was a matter for reproach butnow he d lef Chicago and come east in a fashion that rathertook your breath away for instance he d brought down astring of polo ponies from Lake Forest It was hard to real-ize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enoughto do that
Why they came east I don t know Tey had spent a yearin France for no particular reason and then drifed hereand there unrestfully wherever people played polo and wererich together Tis was a permanent move said Daisy overthe telephone but I didn t believe it I had no sight intoDaisy s heart but I felt that Tom would drif on forever seek-ing a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of someirrecoverable football game
The Great Gatsby  And so it happened that on a warm windy evening Idrove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarce-ly knew at all Teir house was even more elaborate than Iexpected a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial man-sion overlooking the bay Te lawn started at the beach andran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile jumpingover sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens fnal-ly when it reached the house drifing up the side in brightvines as though from the momentum of its run Te frontwas broken by a line of French windows glowing now withrefected gold and wide open to the warm windy afernoonand Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with hislegs apart on the front porch
He had changed since his New Haven years Now hewas a sturdy straw haired man of thirty with a rather hardmouth and a supercilious manner Two shining arroganteyes had established dominance over his face and gave himthe appearance of always leaning aggressively forward Noteven the efeminate swank of his riding clothes could hidethe enormous power of that body he seemed to fll thoseglistening boots until he strained the top lacing and youcould see a great pack of muscle shifing when his shouldermoved under his thin coat It was a body capable of enor-mous leverage a cruel body
His speaking voice a gruf husky tenor added to the im-pression of fractiousness he conveyed Tere was a touch ofpaternal contempt in it even toward people he liked andthere were men at New Haven who had hated his guts Now don t think my opinion on these matters is fnal Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    he seemed to say  just because I m stronger and more of aman than you are  We were in the same Senior Society andwhile we were never intimate I always had the impressionthat he approved of me and wanted me to like him withsome harsh defant wistfulness of his own
We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch I ve got a nice place here  he said his eyes fashing aboutrestlessly
Turning me around by one arm he moved a broad fathand along the front vista including in its sweep a sunkenItalian garden a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snub-nosed motor boat that bumped the tide of shore It belonged to Demaine the oil man  He turned mearound again politely and abruptly  We ll go inside We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space fragilely bound into the house by Frenchwindows at either end Te windows were ajar and gleamingwhite against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow alittle way into the house A breeze blew through the roomblew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale fagstwisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of theceiling and then rippled over the wine-colored rug mak-ing a shadow on it as wind does on the sea
Te only completely stationary object in the room was anenormous couch on which two young women were buoyedup as though upon an anchored balloon Tey were bothin white and their dresses were rippling and futtering as ifthey had just been blown back in afer a short fight aroundthe house I must have stood for a few moments listening to10    The Great Gatsbythe whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a pic-ture on the wall Ten there was a boom as Tom Buchananshut the rear windows and the caught wind died out aboutthe room and the curtains and the rugs and the two youngwomen ballooned slowly to the foor
Te younger of the two was a stranger to me She wasextended full length at her end of the divan completelymotionless and with her chin raised a little as if she werebalancing something on it which was quite likely to fall Ifshe saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint ofit indeed I was almost surprised into murmuring an apol-ogy for having disturbed her by coming in
Te other girl Daisy made an attempt to rise sheleaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression then she laughed an absurd charming little laugh and Ilaughed too and came forward into the room
I m p-paralyzed with happiness
She laughed again as if she said something very wittyand held my hand for a moment looking up into my facepromising that there was no one in the world she so muchwanted to see Tat was a way she had She hinted in a mur-mur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker I veheard it said that Daisy s murmur was only to make peoplelean toward her an irrelevant criticism that made it no lesscharming
At any rate Miss Baker s lips futtered she nodded at mealmost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head backagain the object she was balancing had obviously tottereda little and given her something of a fright Again a sort ofFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    11apology arose to my lips Almost any exhibition of completeself sufciency draws a stunned tribute from meI looked back at my cousin who began to ask me ques-tions in her low thrilling voice It was the kind of voice thatthe ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrange-ment of notes that will never be played again Her face wassad and lovely with bright things in it bright eyes and abright passionate mouth but there was an excitement inher voice that men who had cared for her found difcult toforget a singing compulsion a whispered  Listen  a prom-ise that she had done gay exciting things just a while sinceand that there were gay exciting things hovering in the nexthour
I told her how I had stopped of in Chicago for a day onmy way east and how a dozen people had sent their lovethrough me
Do they miss me  she cried ecstatically
Te whole town is desolate All the cars have the lef rearwheel painted black as a mourning wreath and there s a per-sistent wail all night along the North Shore
How gorgeous Let s go back Tom Tomorrow  Tenshe added irrelevantly  You ought to see the baby  I d like to
She s asleep She s two years old Haven t you ever seenher
Never
Well you ought to see her She s
Tom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly aboutthe room stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder1    The Great Gatsby   What you doing Nick
I m a bond man
Who with
I told him
Never heard of them  he remarked decisivelyTis annoyed me
You will  I answered shortly  You will if you stay in theEast
Oh I ll stay in the East don t you worry  he said glanc-ing at Daisy and then back at me as if he were alert forsomething more  I d be a God Damned fool to live any-where else
At this point Miss Baker said  Absolutely  with suchsuddenness that I started it was the frst word she utteredsince I came into the room Evidently it surprised her asmuch as it did me for she yawned and with a series of rapiddef movements stood up into the room
I m stif  she complained  I ve been lying on that sofafor as long as I can remember
Don t look at me  Daisy retorted  I ve been trying to getyou to New York all afernoon
No thanks  said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just infrom the pantry  I m absolutely in training
Her host looked at her incredulously
You are  He took down his drink as if it were a drop inthe bottom of a glass  How you ever get anything done isbeyond me
I looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she  gotdone  I enjoyed looking at her She was a slender small-Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1breasted girl with an erect carriage which she accentuatedby throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a youngcadet Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me withpolite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan charming discon-tented face It occurred to me now that I had seen her or apicture of her somewhere before
You live in West Egg  she remarked contemptuously  Iknow somebody there
I don t know a single
You must know Gatsby
Gatsby  demanded Daisy  What Gatsby
Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinnerwas announced wedging his tense arm imperatively un-der mine Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room asthough he were moving a checker to another squareSlenderly languidly their hands set lightly on their hipsthe two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-coloredporch open toward the sunset where four candles fickeredon the table in the diminished wind
Why  CANDLES   objected  Daisy  frowning  Shesnapped them out with her fngers  In two weeks it ll be thelongest day in the year  She looked at us all radiantly  Doyou always watch for the longest day of the year and thenmiss it I always watch for the longest day in the year andthen miss it
We ought to plan something  yawned Miss Baker sit-ting down at the table as if she were getting into bed All right  said Daisy  What ll we plan  She turned tome helplessly  What do people plan
1    The Great Gatsby  Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed ex-pression on her little fnger
Look  she complained  I hurt it
We all looked the knuckle was black and blue You did it Tom  she said accusingly  I know you didn tmean to but you DID do it Tat s what I get for marryinga brute of a man a great big hulking physical specimen ofa
I hate that word hulking  objected Tom crossly  even inkidding
Hulking  insisted Daisy
Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once unobtru-sively and with a bantering inconsequence that was neverquite chatter that was as cool as their white dresses andtheir impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire Tey werehere and they accepted Tom and me making only a po-lite pleasant efort to entertain or to be entertained Teyknew that presently dinner would be over and a little laterthe evening too would be over and casually put away It wassharply diferent from the West where an evening was hur-ried from phase to phase toward its close in a continuallydisappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread ofthe moment itself
You make me feel uncivilized Daisy  I confessed on mysecond glass of corky but rather impressive claret  Can tyou talk about crops or something
I meant nothing in particular by this remark but it wastaken up in an unexpected way
Civilization s going to pieces  broke out Tom violentlyFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1 I ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things Have youread  Te Rise of the Coloured Empires  by this man God-dard
Why no  I answered rather surprised by his tone Well it s a fne book and everybody ought to read it Teidea is if we don t look out the white race will be will be ut-terly submerged It s all scientifc stuf it s been proved  Tom s getting very profound  said Daisy with an expres-sion of unthoughtful sadness  He reads deep books withlong words in them What was that word we    Well these books are all scientifc  insisted Tom glanc-ing at her impatiently  Tis fellow has worked out the wholething It s up to us who are the dominant race to watch outor these other races will have control of things  We ve got to beat them down  whispered Daisy wink-ing ferociously toward the fervent sun
You ought to live in California   began Miss Baker butTom interrupted her by shifing heavily in his chair Tis idea is that we re Nordics I am and you are andyou are and    Afer an infnitesimal hesitation he in-cluded Daisy with a slight nod and she winked at me again  and we ve produced all the things that go to make civili-zation oh science and art and all that Do you see Tere was something pathetic in his concentration as ifhis complacency more acute than of old was not enough tohim any more When almost immediately the telephonerang inside and the butler lef the porch Daisy seized uponthe momentary interruption and leaned toward me I ll tell you a family secret  she whispered enthusiasti-1    The Great Gatsbycally  It s about the butler s nose Do you want to hear aboutthe butler s nose
Tat s why I came over tonight
Well he wasn t always a butler he used to be the sil-ver polisher for some people in New York that had a silverservice for two hundred people He had to polish it frommorning till night until fnally it began to afect his nose
Tings went from bad to worse  suggested Miss Baker Yes Tings went from bad to worse until fnally he hadto give up his position
For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic afec-tion upon her glowing face her voice compelled me forwardbreathlessly as I listened then the glow faded each lightdeserting her with lingering regret like children leaving apleasant street at dusk
Te butler came back and murmured something close toTom s ear whereupon Tom frowned pushed back his chairand without a word went inside As if his absence quickenedsomething within her Daisy leaned forward again her voiceglowing and singing
I love to see you at my table Nick You remind me of a of a rose an absolute rose Doesn t he  She turned to MissBaker for confrmation  An absolute rose
Tis was untrue I am not even faintly like a rose Shewas only extemporizing but a stirring warmth fowed fromher as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealedin one of those breathless thrilling words Ten suddenlyshe threw her napkin on the table and excused herself andFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1went into the house
Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance conscious-ly devoid of meaning I was about to speak when she satup alertly and said  Sh  in a warning voice A subdued im-passioned murmur was audible in the room beyond andMiss Baker leaned forward unashamed trying to hear Temurmur trembled on the verge of coherence sank downmounted excitedly and then ceased altogether Tis Mr Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor    Isaid
Don t talk I want to hear what happens
Is something happening  I inquired innocently You mean to say you don t know  said Miss Baker hon-estly surprised  I thought everybody knew
I don t
Why    she said hesitantly  Tom s got some womanin New York
Got some woman  I repeated blankly
Miss Baker nodded
She might have the decency not to telephone him at din-ner-time Don t you think
Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was thefutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tomand Daisy were back at the table
It couldn t be helped  cried Daisy with tense gayetyShe sat down glanced searchingly at Miss Baker andthen at me and continued  I looked outdoors for a minuteand it s very romantic outdoors Tere s a bird on the lawnthat I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard1    The Great Gatsbyor White Star Line He s singing away    her voice sang   It s romantic isn t it Tom
Very romantic  he said and then miserably to me  Ifit s light enough afer dinner I want to take you down to thestables
Te telephone rang inside startlingly and as Daisy shookher head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables in factall subjects vanished into air Among the broken fragmentsof the last fve minutes at table I remember the candles beinglit again pointlessly and I was conscious of wanting to looksquarely at every one and yet to avoid all eyes I couldn tguess what Daisy and Tom were thinking but I doubt if evenMiss Baker who seemed to have mastered a certain hardyskepticism was able utterly to put this ffh guest s shrill me-tallic urgency out of mind To a certain temperament thesituation might have seemed intriguing my own instinctwas to telephone immediately for the police
Te horses needless to say were not mentioned againTom and Miss Baker with several feet of twilight betweenthem strolled back into the library as if to a vigil beside aperfectly tangible body while trying to look pleasantly in-terested and a little deaf I followed Daisy around a chainof connecting verandas to the porch in front In its deepgloom we sat down side by side on a wicker setteeDaisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its love-ly shape and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvetdusk I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her so I askedwhat I thought would be some sedative questions about herlittle girl
Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1   We don t know each other very well Nick  she saidsuddenly  Even if we are cousins You didn t come to mywedding
I wasn t back from the war
Tat s true  She hesitated  Well I ve had a very badtime Nick and I m pretty cynical about everything Evidently she had reason to be I waited but she didn t sayany more and afer a moment I returned rather feebly to thesubject of her daughter
I suppose she talks and eats and everything  Oh yes  She looked at me absently  Listen Nick let metell you what I said when she was born Would you like tohear
Very much
It ll show you how I ve gotten to feel about thingsWell she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knowswhere I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandonedfeeling and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or agirl She told me it was a girl and so I turned my head awayand wept  All right  I said  I m glad it s a girl And I hopeshe ll be a fool that s the best thing a girl can be in thisworld a beautiful little fool
You see I think everything s terrible anyhow  she wenton in a convinced way  Everybody thinks so the most ad-vanced people And I KNOW I ve been everywhere and seeneverything and done everything  Her eyes fashed aroundher in a defant way rather like Tom s and she laughed withthrilling scorn  Sophisticated God I m sophisticated Te instant her voice broke of ceasing to compel my0    The Great Gatsbyattention my belief I felt the basic insincerity of what shehad said It made me uneasy as though the whole eveninghad been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emo-tion from me I waited and sure enough in a moment shelooked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face as ifshe had asserted her membership in a rather distinguishedsecret society to which she and Tom belonged
Inside the crimson room bloomed with light Tom andMiss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she readaloud to him from the  Saturday Evening Post  the wordsmurmurous and uninfected running together in a sooth-ing tune Te lamp-light bright on his boots and dull onthe autumn-leaf yellow of her hair glinted along the paperas she turned a page with a futter of slender muscles in herarms
When we came in she held us silent for a moment witha lifed hand
To be continued  she said tossing the magazine on thetable  in our very next issue
Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of herknee and she stood up
Ten o clock  she remarked apparently fnding the timeon the ceiling  Time for this good girl to go to bed  Jordan s going to play in the tournament tomorrow  ex-plained Daisy  over at Westchester
Oh you re JORdan Baker
I knew now why her face was familiar its pleasing con-temptuous expression had looked out at me from manyrotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville andFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1Hot Springs and Palm Beach I had heard some story of hertoo a critical unpleasant story but what it was I had forgot-ten long ago
Good night  she said sofly  Wake me at eight won tyou
If you ll get up
I will Good night Mr Carraway See you anon  Of course you will  confrmed Daisy  In fact I thinkI ll arrange a marriage Come over ofen Nick and I ll sortof oh fing you together You know lock you up acci-dentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boatand all that sort of thing
Good night  called Miss Baker from the stairs  I haven theard a word
She s a nice girl  said Tom afer a moment  Tey oughtn tto let her run around the country this way
Who oughtn t to  inquired Daisy coldly
Her family
Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old Be-sides Nick s going to look afer her aren t you Nick She sgoing to spend lots of week-ends out here this summer Ithink the home infuence will be very good for her Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in si-lence
Is she from New York  I asked quickly
From Louisville Our white girlhood was passed togeth-er there Our beautiful white
Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the ve-randa  demanded Tom suddenly
The Great Gatsby   Did I  She looked at me  I can t seem to remember but Ithink we talked about the Nordic race Yes I m sure we didIt sort of crept up on us and frst thing you know    Don t believe everything you hear Nick  he advisedme
I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all and a fewminutes later I got up to go home Tey came to the doorwith me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of lightAs I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called  Wait I forgot to ask you something and it s important Weheard you were engaged to a girl out West
Tat s right  corroborated Tom kindly  We heard thatyou were engaged
It s libel I m too poor
But we heard it  insisted Daisy surprising me by open-ing up again in a fower-like way  We heard it from threepeople so it must be true
Of course I knew what they were referring to but I wasn teven vaguely engaged Te fact that gossip had publishedthe banns was one of the reasons I had come east You can tstop going with an old friend on account of rumors and onthe other hand I had no intention of being rumored intomarriage
Teir interest rather touched me and made them lessremotely rich nevertheless I was confused and a little dis-gusted as I drove away It seemed to me that the thing forDaisy to do was to rush out of the house child in arms butapparently there were no such intentions in her head As forTom the fact that he  had some woman in New York  wasFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    really less surprising than that he had been depressed by abook Something was making him nibble at the edge of staleideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourishedhis peremptory heart
Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs andin front of wayside garages where new red gas-pumps satout in pools of light and when I reached my estate at WestEgg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on anabandoned grass roller in the yard Te wind had blown ofleaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the treesand a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earthblew the frogs full of life Te silhouette of a moving cat wa-vered across the moonlight and turning my head to watchit I saw that I was not alone ffy feet away a fgure hademerged from the shadow of my neighbor s mansion andwas standing with his hands in his pockets regarding thesilver pepper of the stars Something in his leisurely move-ments and the secure position of his feet upon the lawnsuggested that it was Mr Gatsby himself come out to deter-mine what share was his of our local heavens
I decided to call to him Miss Baker had mentioned himat dinner and that would do for an introduction But Ididn t call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that hewas content to be alone he stretched out his arms towardthe dark water in a curious way and far as I was from him Icould have sworn he was trembling Involuntarily I glancedseaward and distinguished nothing except a single greenlight minute and far away that might have been the end ofa dock When I looked once more for Gatsby he had van-    The Great Gatsbyished and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness

Te valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foulriver and when the drawbridge is up to let barges throughthe passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismalscene for as long as half an hour Tere is always a halt thereof at least a minute and it was because of this that I frst metTom Buchanan s mistress

No he doesn t  said Tom coldly  And if you feel that wayabout it maybe I d better sell it somewhere else afer all  I don t mean that  explained Wilson quickly  I justmeant
His voice faded of and Tom glanced impatiently aroundthe garage Ten I heard footsteps on a stairs and in a mo-ment the thickish fgure of a woman blocked out the lightfrom the ofce door She was in the middle thirties andfaintly stout but she carried her surplus fesh sensuously assome women can Her face above a spotted dress of darkblue crepe-de-chine contained no facet or gleam of beauty    The Great Gatsbybut there was an immediately perceptible vitality about heras if the nerves of her body were continually smoulderingShe smiled slowly and walking through her husband as if hewere a ghost shook hands with Tom looking him fush inthe eye Ten she wet her lips and without turning aroundspoke to her husband in a sof coarse voice
Get some chairs why don t you so somebody can sitdown
Oh sure  agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward thelittle ofce mingling immediately with the cement color ofthe walls A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and hispale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity except hiswife who moved close to Tom
I want to see you  said Tom intently  Get on the nexttrain
All right
I ll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level She nodded and moved away from him just as GeorgeWilson emerged with two chairs from his ofce doorWe waited for her down the road and out of sight It wasa few days before the Fourth of July and a grey scrawnyItalian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the rail-road track
Terrible place isn t it  said Tom exchanging a frownwith Doctor Eckleburg
Awful
It does her good to get away
Doesn t her husband object
Wilson He thinks she goes to see her sister in NewFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    York He s so dumb he doesn t know he s alive
So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up togeth-er to New York or not quite together for Mrs Wilsonsat discreetly in another car Tom deferred that much tothe sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on thetrain
She had changed her dress to a brown fgured mus-lin which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tomhelped her to the platform in New York At the news-standshe bought a copy of  Town Tattle  and a moving-picturemagazine and in the station drug store some cold creamand a small fask of perfume Upstairs in the solemn echo-ing drive she let four taxi cabs drive away before she selecteda new one lavender-colored with grey upholstery and inthis we slid out from the mass of the station into the glow-ing sunshine But immediately she turned sharply from thewindow and leaning forward tapped on the front glass I want to get one of those dogs  she said earnestly  Iwant to get one for the apartment Tey re nice to have adog
We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd re-semblance to John D Rockefeller In a basket swung fromhis neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an inde-terminate breed
What kind are they  asked Mrs Wilson eagerly as hecame to the taxi-window
All kinds What kind do you want lady
I d like to get one of those police dogs I don t supposeyou got that kind
0    The Great Gatsby  Te man peered doubtfully into the basket plunged inhis hand and drew one up wriggling by the back of theneck
Tat s no police dog  said Tom
No it s not exactly a polICE dog  said the man withdisappointment in his voice  It s more of an airedale  Hepassed his hand over the brown wash-rag of a back  Lookat that coat Some coat Tat s a dog that ll never bother youwith catching cold
I think it s cute  said Mrs Wilson enthusiastically  Howmuch is it
Tat dog  He looked at it admiringly  Tat dog will costyou ten dollars
Te airedale undoubtedly there was an airedale con-cerned in it somewhere though its feet were startlinglywhite changed hands and settled down into Mrs Wilson slap where she fondled the weather-proof coat with rapture Is it a boy or a girl  she asked delicately
Tat dog Tat dog s a boy
It s a bitch  said Tom decisively  Here s your money Goand buy ten more dogs with it
We drove over to Fifh Avenue so warm and sof almostpastoral on the summer Sunday afernoon that I wouldn thave been surprised to see a great fock of white sheep turnthe corner
Hold on  I said  I have to leave you here
No you don t  interposed Tom quickly  Myrtle ll behurt if you don t come up to the apartment Won t youMyrtle

Well I d like to but
We went on cutting back again over the Park toward theWest Hundreds At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slicein a long white cake of apartment houses Trowing a regalhomecoming glance around the neighborhood Mrs Wil-son gathered up her dog and her other purchases and wenthaughtily in
I m going to have the McKees come up  she announcedas we rose in the elevator  And of course I got to call up mysister too
Te apartment was on the top foor a small livingroom a small dining room a small bedroom and a bathTe living room was crowded to the doors with a set of tap-estried furniture entirely too large for it so that to moveabout was to stumble continually over scenes of ladiesswinging in the gardens of Versailles Te only picture wasan over-enlarged photograph apparently a hen sitting ona blurred rock Looked at from a distance however the henresolved itself into a bonnet and the countenance of a stoutold lady beamed down into the room Several old copies of Town Tattle  lay on the table together with a copy of  SimonCalled Peter  and some of the small scandal magazines ofBroadway Mrs Wilson was frst concerned with the dog Areluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and somemilk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of largehard dog biscuits one of which decomposed apathetically    The Great Gatsbyin the saucer of milk all afernoon Meanwhile Tom broughtout a bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau doorI have been drunk just twice in my life and the secondtime was that afernoon so everything that happened has adim hazy cast over it although until afer eight o clock theapartment was full of cheerful sun Sitting on Tom s lapMrs Wilson called up several people on the telephone thenthere were no cigarettes and I went out to buy some at thedrug store on the corner When I came back they had disap-peared so I sat down discreetly in the living room and reada chapter of  Simon Called Peter  either it was terrible stufor the whiskey distorted things because it didn t make anysense to me
Just as Tom and Myrtle afer the frst drink Mrs Wil-son and I called each other by our frst names reappearedcompany commenced to arrive at the apartment doorTe sister Catherine was a slender worldly girl of aboutthirty with a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexionpowdered milky white Her eyebrows had been plucked andthen drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the efortsof nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gavea blurred air to her face When she moved about there wasan incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jin-gled up and down upon her arms She came in with such aproprietary haste and looked around so possessively at thefurniture that I wondered if she lived here But when I askedher she laughed immoderately repeated my question aloudand told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotelMr McKee was a pale feminine man from the fat belowFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    He had just shaved for there was a white spot of lather onhis cheekbone and he was most respectful in his greeting toeveryone in the room He informed me that he was in the artistic game  and I gathered later that he was a photogra-pher and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs Wilson smother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall Hiswife was shrill languid handsome and horrible She toldme with pride that her husband had photographed her ahundred and twenty-seven times since they had been mar-ried
Mrs Wilson had changed her costume some time be-fore and was now attired in an elaborate afernoon dress ofcream colored chifon which gave out a continual rustle asshe swept about the room With the infuence of the dressher personality had also undergone a change Te intensevitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was con-verted into impressive hauteur Her laughter her gesturesher assertions became more violently afected moment bymoment and as she expanded the room grew smaller aroundher until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy creakingpivot through the smoky air
My dear  she told her sister in a high mincing shout most of these fellas will cheat you every time All they thinkof is money I had a woman up here last week to look at myfeet and when she gave me the bill you d of thought she hadmy appendicitus out
What was the name of the woman  asked Mrs McKee Mrs Eberhardt She goes around looking at people s feetin their own homes
The Great Gatsby   I like your dress  remarked Mrs McKee  I think it sadorable
Mrs Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eye-brow in disdain
It s just a crazy old thing  she said  I just slip it on some-times when I don t care what I look like
But it looks wonderful on you if you know what I mean pursued Mrs McKee  If Chester could only get you in thatpose I think he could make something of it
We all looked in silence at Mrs Wilson who removed astrand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us witha brilliant smile Mr McKee regarded her intently with hishead on one side and then moved his hand back and forthslowly in front of his face
I should change the light  he said afer a moment  I dlike to bring out the modelling of the features And I d tryto get hold of all the back hair
I wouldn t think of changing the light  cried Mrs McK-ee  I think it s
Her husband said  SH  and we all looked at the subjectagain whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and gotto his feet
You McKees have something to drink  he said  Getsome more ice and mineral water Myrtle before everybodygoes to sleep
I told that boy about the ice  Myrtle raised her eyebrowsin despair at the shiflessness of the lower orders  Tesepeople You have to keep afer them all the time She looked at me and laughed pointlessly Ten sheFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    founced over to the dog kissed it with ecstasy and sweptinto the kitchen implying that a dozen chefs awaited herorders there
I ve done some nice things out on Long Island  assertedMr McKee
Tom looked at him blankly
Two of them we have framed downstairs
Two what  demanded Tom
Two studies One of them I call  Montauk Point theGulls  and the other I call  Montauk Point the Sea   Te sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch Do you live down on Long Island too  she inquired I live at West Egg
Really I was down there at a party about a month agoAt a man named Gatsby s Do you know him
I live next door to him
Well they say he s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wil-helm s Tat s where all his money comes from  Really
She nodded
I m scared of him I d hate to have him get anything onme
Tis absorbing information about my neighbor was in-terrupted by Mrs McKee s pointing suddenly at Catherine Chester I think you could do something with HER  shebroke out but Mr McKee only nodded in a bored way andturned his attention to Tom
I d like to do more work on Long Island if I could get theentry All I ask is that they should give me a start     The Great Gatsby   Ask Myrtle  said Tom breaking into a short shout oflaughter as Mrs Wilson entered with a tray  She ll give youa letter of introduction won t you Myrtle
Do what  she asked startled
You ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your hus-band so he can do some studies of him  His lips movedsilently for a moment as he invented    George B Wilson atthe Gasoline Pump  or something like that
Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear Neither of them can stand the person they re married to  Can t they
Can t STAND them  She looked at Myrtle and then atTom  What I say is why go on living with them if they can tstand them If I was them I d get a divorce and get marriedto each other right away
Doesn t she like Wilson either
Te answer to this was unexpected It came from Myrtlewho had overheard the question and it was violent and ob-scene
You see  cried Catherine triumphantly She lowered hervoice again  It s really his wife that s keeping them apartShe s a Catholic and they don t believe in divorce Daisy was not a Catholic and I was a little shocked at theelaborateness of the lie
When they do get married  continued Catherine they re going west to live for a while until it blows over  It d be more discreet to go to Europe
Oh do you like Europe  she exclaimed surprisingly  Ijust got back from Monte Carlo
Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom       Really
Just last year I went over there with another girl  Stay long
No we just went to Monte Carlo and back We wentby way of Marseilles We had over twelve hundred dollarswhen we started but we got gypped out of it all in two daysin the private rooms We had an awful time getting back Ican tell you God how I hated that town
Te late afernoon sky bloomed in the window for a mo-ment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean then theshrill voice of Mrs McKee called me back into the room I almost made a mistake too  she declared vigorously  Ialmost married a little kyke who d been afer me for yearsI knew he was below me Everybody kept saying to me  Lu-cille that man s way below you  But if I hadn t met Chesterhe d of got me sure
Yes but listen  said Myrtle Wilson nodding her headup and down  at least you didn t marry him
I know I didn t
Well I married him  said Myrtle ambiguously  Andthat s the diference between your case and mine  Why did you Myrtle  demanded Catherine  Nobodyforced you to
Myrtle considered
I married him because I thought he was a gentleman she said fnally  I thought he knew something about breed-ing but he wasn t ft to lick my shoe
You were crazy about him for a while  said Catherine Crazy about him  cried Myrtle incredulously  Who said    The Great GatsbyI was crazy about him I never was any more crazy abouthim than I was about that man there
She pointed suddenly at me and every one looked atme accusingly I tried to show by my expression that I hadplayed no part in her past
Te only CRAZY I was was when I married him I knewright away I made a mistake He borrowed somebody s bestsuit to get married in and never even told me about it andthe man came afer it one day when he was out She lookedaround to see who was listening    Oh is that your suit  Isaid  Tis is the frst I ever heard about it  But I gave it tohim and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all af-ternoon
She really ought to get away from him  resumed Cath-erine to me  Tey ve been living over that garage for elevenyears And Tom s the frst sweetie she ever had Te bottle of whiskey a second one was now in con-stant demand by all present excepting Catherine who  feltjust as good on nothing at all  Tom rang for the janitorand sent him for some celebrated sandwiches which werea complete supper in themselves I wanted to get out andwalk eastward toward the park through the sof twilight buteach time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild stri-dent argument which pulled me back as if with ropes intomy chair Yet high over the city our line of yellow windowsmust have contributed their share of human secrecy to thecasual watcher in the darkening streets and I was him toolooking up and wondering I was within and without si-multaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustibleFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    variety of life
Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine and suddenly herwarm breath poured over me the story of her frst meetingwith Tom
It was on the two little seats facing each other that arealways the last ones lef on the train I was going up to NewYork to see my sister and spend the night He had on a dresssuit and patent leather shoes and I couldn t keep my eyes ofhim but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to belooking at the advertisement over his head When we cameinto the station he was next to me and his white shirt-frontpressed against my arm and so I told him I d have to calla policeman but he knew I lied I was so excited that whenI got into a taxi with him I didn t hardly know I wasn t get-ting into a subway train All I kept thinking about over andover was  You can t live forever you can t live forever   She turned to Mrs McKee and the room rang full of herartifcial laughter
My dear  she cried  I m going to give you this dress assoon as I m through with it I ve got to get another one to-morrow I m going to make a list of all the things I ve got toget A massage and a wave and a collar for the dog and oneof those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring anda wreath with a black silk bow for mother s grave that ll lastall summer I got to write down a list so I won t forget all thethings I got to do
It was nine o clock almost immediately aferward Ilooked at my watch and found it was ten Mr McKee wasasleep on a chair with his fsts clenched in his lap like a0    The Great Gatsbyphotograph of a man of action Taking out my handkerchiefI wiped from his cheek the remains of the spot of dried lath-er that had worried me all the afernoon
Te little dog was sitting on the table looking with blindeyes through the smoke and from time to time groaningfaintly People disappeared reappeared made plans to gosomewhere and then lost each other searched for eachother found each other a few feet away Some time towardmidnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs Wilson stood face toface discussing in impassioned voices whether Mrs Wilsonhad any right to mention Daisy s name

Making a short def movement Tom Buchanan broke hernose with his open hand
Ten there were bloody towels upon the bathroom foorand women s voices scolding and high over the confusiona long broken wail of pain Mr McKee awoke from his dozeand started in a daze toward the door When he had gonehalf way he turned around and stared at the scene his wifeand Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbledhere and there among the crowded furniture with articlesof aid and the despairing fgure on the couch bleeding fu-ently and trying to spread a copy of  Town Tattle  over thetapestry scenes of Versailles Ten Mr McKee turned andcontinued on out the door Taking my hat from the chan-delier I followed

By seven o clock the orchestra has arrived no thin fve-piece afair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones andsaxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low andhigh drums Te last swimmers have come in from the beachnow and are dressing upstairs the cars from New York areparked fve deep in the drive and already the halls and sa-lons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hairshorn in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreamsof Castile Te bar is in full swing and foating rounds ofcocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alivewith chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and intro-ductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetingsbetween women who never knew each other s namesTe lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away fromthe sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktailmusic and the opera of voices pitches a key higher Laughteris easier minute by minute spilled with prodigality tippedout at a cheerful word Te groups change more swif-ly swell with new arrivals dissolve and form in the samebreath already there are wanderers confdent girls whoweave here and there among the stouter and more stable    The Great Gatsbybecome for a sharp joyous moment the center of a groupand then excited with triumph glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantlychanging light

I had been actually invited A chaufeur in a uniform ofrobin s egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morn-ing with a surprisingly formal note from his employer thehonor would be entirely Gatsby s it said if I would attendhis  little party  that night He had seen me several timesand had intended to call on me long before but a peculiarcombination of circumstances had prevented it signed JayFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    Gatsby in a majestic hand
Dressed up in white fannels I went over to his lawn alittle afer seven and wandered around rather ill-at-easeamong swirls and eddies of people I didn t know thoughhere and there was a face I had noticed on the commut-ing train I was immediately struck by the number of youngEnglishmen dotted about all well dressed all looking a lit-tle hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid andprosperous Americans I was sure that they were sellingsomething bonds or insurance or automobiles Tey wereat least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicin-ity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in theright key
As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to fnd my hostbut the two or three people of whom I asked his where-abouts stared at me in such an amazed way and denied sovehemently any knowledge of his movements that I slunkof in the direction of the cocktail table the only place inthe garden where a single man could linger without lookingpurposeless and alone
I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer em-barrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house andstood at the head of the marble steps leaning a little back-ward and looking with contemptuous interest down intothe garden
Welcome or not I found it necessary to attach myself tosomeone before I should begin to address cordial remarksto the passers-by
Hello  I roared advancing toward her My voice seemed    The Great Gatsbyunnaturally loud across the garden
I thought you might be here  she responded absently as Icame up  I remembered you lived next door to   She held my hand impersonally as a promise that she dtake care of me in a minute and gave ear to two girls in twinyellow dresses who stopped at the foot of the steps Hello  they cried together  Sorry you didn t win Tat was for the golf tournament She had lost in the f-nals the week before
You don t know who we are  said one of the girls in yel-low  but we met you here about a month ago
You ve dyed your hair since then  remarked Jordan andI started but the girls had moved casually on and her re-mark was addressed to the premature moon produced likethe supper no doubt out of a caterer s basket With Jordan sslender golden arm resting in mine we descended the stepsand sauntered about the garden A tray of cocktails foatedat us through the twilight and we sat down at a table withthe two girls in yellow and three men each one introducedto us as Mr Mumble
Do you come to these parties ofen  inquired Jordan ofthe girl beside her
Te last one was the one I met you at  answered the girlin an alert confdent voice She turned to her companion Wasn t it for you Lucille
It was for Lucille too
I like to come  Lucille said  I never care what I do soI always have a good time When I was here last I tore mygown on a chair and he asked me my name and address Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    inside of a week I got a package from Croirier s with a newevening gown in it
Did you keep it  asked Jordan
Sure I did I was going to wear it tonight but it was toobig in the bust and had to be altered It was gas blue withlavender beads Two hundred and sixty-fve dollars  Tere s something funny about a fellow that ll do a thinglike that  said the other girl eagerly  He doesn t want anytrouble with ANYbody
Who doesn t  I inquired
Gatsby Somebody told me
Te two girls and Jordan leaned together confdentially Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once A thrill passed over all of us Te three Mr Mumblesbent forward and listened eagerly
I don t think it s so much THAT  argued Lucille skepti-cally  it s more that he was a German spy during the war One of the men nodded in confrmation
I heard that from a man who knew all about him grewup with him in Germany  he assured us positively Oh no  said the frst girl  it couldn t be that because hewas in the American army during the war  As our credulityswitched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody s look-ing at him I ll bet he killed a man
She narrowed her eyes and shivered Lucille shiveredWe all turned and looked around for Gatsby It was testimo-ny to the romantic speculation he inspired that there werewhispers about him from those who found little that it was    The Great Gatsbynecessary to whisper about in this world
Te frst supper there would be another one afer mid-night was now being served and Jordan invited me to joinher own party who were spread around a table on the otherside of the garden Tere were three married couples andJordan s escort a persistent undergraduate given to violentinnuendo and obviously under the impression that sooneror later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to agreater or lesser degree Instead of rambling this party hadpreserved a dignifed homogeneity and assumed to itself thefunction of representing the staid nobility of the country-side East Egg condescending to West Egg and carefullyon guard against its spectroscopic gayety
Let s get out  whispered Jordan afer a somehow waste-ful and inappropriate half hour  Tis is much too polite forme
We got up and she explained that we were going to fndthe host I had never met him she said and it was makingme uneasy Te undergraduate nodded in a cynical melan-choly way
Te bar where we glanced frst was crowded but Gatsbywas not there She couldn t fnd him from the top of thesteps and he wasn t on the veranda On a chance we triedan important-looking door and walked into a high Goth-ic library panelled with carved English oak and probablytransported complete from some ruin overseasA stout middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spec-tacles was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a greattable staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves ofFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    books As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and ex-amined Jordan from head to foot
What do you think  he demanded impetuously About what
He waved his hand toward the book-shelves About that As a matter of fact you needn t bother to as-certain I ascertained Tey re real
Te books
He nodded
Absolutely real have pages and everything I thoughtthey d be a nice durable cardboard Matter of fact they reabsolutely real Pages and Here Lemme show you Taking our skepticism for granted he rushed to thebookcases and returned with Volume One of the  StoddardLectures
See  he cried triumphantly  It s a bona fde piece ofprinted matter It fooled me Tis fella s a regular BelascoIt s a triumph What thoroughness What realism Knewwhen to stop too didn t cut the pages But what do youwant What do you expect
He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily onits shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the wholelibrary was liable to collapse
Who brought you  he demanded  Or did you just comeI was brought Most people were brought
Jordan looked at him alertly cheerfully without answer-ing
I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt  he con-tinued  Mrs Claud Roosevelt Do you know her I met her0    The Great Gatsbysomewhere last night I ve been drunk for about a week nowand I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library  Has it
A little bit I think I can t tell yet I ve only been here anhour Did I tell you about the books Tey re real Tey re
You told us
We shook hands with him gravely and went back out-doors
Tere was dancing now on the canvas in the gardenold men pushing young girls backward in eternal grace-less circles superior couples holding each other tortuouslyfashionably and keeping in the corners and a great num-ber of single girls dancing individualistically or relievingthe orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or thetraps By midnight the hilarity had increased A celebratedtenor had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sungin jazz and between the numbers people were doing  stunts all over the garden while happy vacuous bursts of laughterrose toward the summer sky A pair of stage  twins  whoturned out to be the girls in yellow did a baby act in cos-tume and champagne was served in glasses bigger thanfnger bowls Te moon had risen higher and foating in theSound was a triangle of silver scales trembling a little to thestif tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn
I was still with Jordan Baker We were sitting at a tablewith a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gaveway upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laugh-ter I was enjoying myself now I had taken two fnger bowlsFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyesinto something signifcant elemental and profoundAt a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me andsmiled
Your face is familiar  he said politely  Weren t you inthe Tird Division during the war
Why yes I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion  I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eigh-teen I knew I d seen you somewhere before
We talked for a moment about some wet grey little vil-lages in France Evidently he lived in this vicinity for he toldme that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going totry it out in the morning
Want to go with me old sport Just near the shore alongthe Sound
What time
Any time that suits you best
It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jor-dan looked around and smiled
Having a gay time now  she inquired
Much better  I turned again to my new acquaintance Tis is an unusual party for me I haven t even seen thehost I live over there    I waved my hand at the invisiblehedge in the distance  and this man Gatsby sent over hischaufeur with an invitation
For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to under-stand
I m Gatsby  he said suddenly
What  I exclaimed  Oh I beg your pardon     The Great Gatsby   I thought you knew old sport I m afraid I m not a verygood host
He smiled understandingly much more than under-standingly It was one of those rare smiles with a quality ofeternal reassurance in it that you may come across four orfve times in life It faced or seemed to face the whole ex-ternal world for an instant and then concentrated on YOUwith an irresistible prejudice in your favor It understoodyou just so far as you wanted to be understood believedin you as you would like to believe in yourself and assuredyou that it had precisely the impression of you that at yourbest you hoped to convey Precisely at that point it van-ished and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck ayear or two over thirty whose elaborate formality of speechjust missed being absurd Some time before he introducedhimself I d got a strong impression that he was picking hiswords with care
Almost at the moment when Mr Gatsby identifed him-self a butler hurried toward him with the information thatChicago was calling him on the wire He excused himselfwith a small bow that included each of us in turn If you want anything just ask for it old sport  he urgedme  Excuse me I will rejoin you later
When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan constrained to assure her of my surprise I had expectedthat Mr Gatsby would be a forid and corpulent person inhis middle years
Who is he  I demanded  Do you know
He s just a man named Gatsby
Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom       Where is he from I mean And what does he do  Now YOU re started on the subject  she answered witha wan smile  Well he told me once he was an Oxfordman
A dim background started to take shape behind him butat her next remark it faded away
However I don t believe it
Why not
I don t know  she insisted  I just don t think he wentthere
Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl s  Ithink he killed a man  and had the efect of stimulating mycuriosity I would have accepted without question the infor-mation that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisianaor from the lower East Side of New York Tat was compre-hensible But young men didn t at least in my provincialinexperience I believed they didn t drif coolly out of no-where and buy a palace on Long Island Sound
Anyhow he gives large parties  said Jordan changingthe subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete  And Ilike large parties Tey re so intimate At small parties thereisn t any privacy
Tere was the boom of a bass drum and the voice of theorchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia ofthe garden
Ladies and gentlemen  he cried  At the request of MrGatsby we are going to play for you Mr Vladimir Tostof slatest work which attracted so much attention at CarnegieHall last May If you read the papers you know there was    The Great Gatsbya big sensation  He smiled with jovial condescension andadded  Some sensation  whereupon everybody laughed Te piece is known  he concluded lustily  as  VladimirTostof s Jazz History of the World
Te nature of Mr Tostof s composition eluded me be-cause just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby standing aloneon the marble steps and looking from one group to anotherwith approving eyes His tanned skin was drawn attractive-ly tight on his face and his short hair looked as though itwere trimmed every day I could see nothing sinister abouthim I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helpedto set him of from his guests for it seemed to me that hegrew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased Whenthe  Jazz History of the World  was over girls were puttingtheir heads on men s shoulders in a puppyish convivialway girls were swooning backward playfully into men sarms even into groups knowing that some one would ar-rest their falls but no one swooned backward on Gatsbyand no French bob touched Gatsby s shoulder and no sing-ing quartets were formed with Gatsby s head for one link I beg your pardon
Gatsby s butler was suddenly standing beside us Miss Baker  he inquired  I beg your pardon but MrGatsby would like to speak to you alone
With me  she exclaimed in surprise
Yes madame
She got up slowly raising her eyebrows at me in aston-ishment and followed the butler toward the house I noticedthat she wore her evening dress all her dresses like sportsFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    clothes there was a jauntiness about her movements as ifshe had frst learned to walk upon golf courses on cleancrisp mornings
I was alone and it was almost two For some time confusedand intriguing sounds had issued from a long many-win-dowed room which overhung the terrace Eluding Jordan sundergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical con-versation with two chorus girls and who implored me tojoin him I went inside
Te large room was full of people One of the girls inyellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tallred haired young lady from a famous chorus engaged insong She had drunk a quantity of champagne and duringthe course of her song she had decided ineptly that every-thing was very very sad she was not only singing she wasweeping too Whenever there was a pause in the song sheflled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyr-ic again in a quavering soprano Te tears coursed downher cheeks not freely however for when they came intocontact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed aninky color and pursued the rest of their way in slow blackrivulets A humorous suggestion was made that she sing thenotes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands sankinto a chair and went of into a deep vinous sleep She had a fght with a man who says he s her husband explained a girl at my elbow
I looked around Most of the remaining women werenow having fghts with men said to be their husbands EvenJordan s party the quartet from East Egg were rent asun-    The Great Gatsbyder by dissension One of the men was talking with curiousintensity to a young actress and his wife afer attempt-ing to laugh at the situation in a dignifed and indiferentway broke down entirely and resorted to fank attacks atintervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angrydiamond and hissed  You promised  into his earTe reluctance to go home was not confned to waywardmen Te hall was at present occupied by two deplorably so-ber men and their highly indignant wives Te wives weresympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices Whenever he sees I m having a good time he wants togo home
Never heard anything so selfsh in my life
We re always the frst ones to leave
So are we
Well we re almost the last tonight  said one of the mensheepishly  Te orchestra lef half an hour ago In spite of the wives  agreement that such malevolencewas beyond credibility the dispute ended in a short strug-gle and both wives were lifed kicking into the nightAs I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the libraryopened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out togetherHe was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in hismanner tightened abruptly into formality as several peopleapproached him to say goodbye
Jordan s party were calling impatiently to her from theporch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands I ve just heard the most amazing thing  she whispered How long were we in there
Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom       Why about an hour
It was simply amazing  she repeated abstractedly  ButI swore I wouldn t tell it and here I am tantalizing you  Sheyawned gracefully in my face  Please come and see me Phone book  Under the name of Mrs Sigourney How-ard  My aunt   She was hurrying of as she talked herbrown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into herparty at the door
Rather ashamed that on my frst appearance I had stayedso late I joined the last of Gatsby s guests who were clus-tered around him I wanted to explain that I d hunted forhim early in the evening and to apologize for not havingknown him in the garden
Don t mention it  he enjoined me eagerly  Don t give itanother thought old sport  Te familiar expression held nomore familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushedmy shoulder  And don t forget we re going up in the hydro-plane tomorrow morning at nine o clock
Ten the butler behind his shoulder
Philadelphia wants you on the phone sir
All right in a minute Tell them I ll be right there good night
Good night
Good night  He smiled and suddenly there seemedto be a pleasant signifcance in having been among the lastto go as if he had desired it all the time  Good night oldsport  Good night
But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening wasnot quite over Fify feet from the door a dozen headlights    The Great Gatsbyilluminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene In the ditch be-side the road right side up but violently shorn of one wheelrested a new coup which had lef Gatsby s drive not twominutes before Te sharp jut of a wall accounted for the de-tachment of the wheel which was now getting considerableattention from half a dozen curious chaufeurs However asthey had lef their cars blocking the road a harsh discordantdin from those in the rear had been audible for some timeand added to the already violent confusion of the sceneA man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreckand now stood in the middle of the road looking from thecar to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleas-ant puzzled way
See  he explained  It went in the ditch
Te fact was infnitely astonishing to him and I rec-ognized frst the unusual quality of wonder and then theman it was the late patron of Gatsby s library How d it happen
He shrugged his shoulders
I know nothing whatever about mechanics  he said de-cisively
But how did it happen Did you run into the wall  Don t ask me  said Owl Eyes washing his hands of thewhole matter  I know very little about driving next tonothing It happened and that s all I know
Well if you re a poor driver you oughtn t to try drivingat night
But I wasn t even trying  he explained indignantly  Iwasn t even trying

Do you want to commit suicide
You re lucky it was just a wheel A bad driver and noteven TRYing
You don t understand  explained the criminal  I wasn tdriving Tere s another man in the car
Te shock that followed this declaration found voice ina sustained  Ah-h-h  as the door of the coup swung slowlyopen Te crowd it was now a crowd stepped back in-voluntarily and when the door had opened wide there wasa ghostly pause Ten very gradually part by part a paledangling individual stepped out of the wreck pawing tenta-tively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoeBlinded by the glare of the headlights and confused bythe incessant groaning of the horns the apparition stoodswaying for a moment before he perceived the man in theduster
Wha s matter  he inquired calmly  Did we run outagas
Look
Half a dozen fngers pointed at the amputated wheel hestared at it for a moment and then looked upward as thoughhe suspected that it had dropped from the sky
It came of  some one explained
He nodded
At frst I din  notice we d stopped
A pause Ten taking a long breath and straighteninghis shoulders he remarked in a determined voice Wonder f tell me where there s a gas line station 0    The Great Gatsby  At least a dozen men some of them little better of thanhe was explained to him that wheel and car were no longerjoined by any physical bond
Back out  he suggested afer a moment  Put her in re-verse
But the WHEEL S of
He hesitated
No harm in trying  he said
Te caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and Iturned away and cut across the lawn toward home I glancedback once A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby shouse making the night fne as before and surviving thelaughter and the sound of his still glowing garden A sud-den emptiness seemed to fow now from the windows andthe great doors endowing with complete isolation the fg-ure of the host who stood on the porch his hand up in aformal gesture of farewell
Reading over what I have written so far I see I have giventhe impression that the events of three nights several weeksapart were all that absorbed me On the contrary they weremerely casual events in a crowded summer and until muchlater they absorbed me infnitely less than my personal af-fairs
Most of the time I worked In the early morning the sunthrew my shadow westward as I hurried down the whitechasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust I knew theother clerks and young bond-salesmen by their frst namesand lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants onlittle pig sausages and mashed potatoes and cofee I evenFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1had a short afair with a girl who lived in Jersey City andworked in the accounting department but her brother be-gan throwing mean looks in my direction so when she wenton her vacation in July I let it blow quietly awayI took dinner usually at the Yale Club for some reasonit was the gloomiest event of my day and then I went up-stairs to the library and studied investments and securitiesfor a conscientious hour Tere were generally a few riotersaround but they never came into the library so it was a goodplace to work Afer that if the night was mellow I strolleddown Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel andover Tirty-third Street to the Pennsylvania StationI began to like New York the racy adventurous feel ofit at night and the satisfaction that the constant ficker ofmen and women and machines gives to the restless eye Iliked to walk up Fifh Avenue and pick out romantic wom-en from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I wasgoing to enter into their lives and no one would ever knowor disapprove Sometimes in my mind I followed them totheir apartments on the corners of hidden streets and theyturned and smiled back at me before they faded througha door into warm darkness At the enchanted metropoli-tan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes andfelt it in others poor young clerks who loitered in front ofwindows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurantdinner young clerks in the dusk wasting the most poi-gnant moments of night and life
Again at eight o clock when the dark lanes of the For-ties were fve deep with throbbing taxi cabs bound for the    The Great Gatsbytheatre district I felt a sinking in my heart Forms leanedtogether in the taxis as they waited and voices sang andthere was laughter from unheard jokes and lighted ciga-rettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside Imaginingthat I too was hurrying toward gayety and sharing theirintimate excitement I wished them well
For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker and then in mid-summer I found her again At frst I was fattered to goplaces with her because she was a golf champion and ev-ery one knew her name Ten it was something more Iwasn t actually in love but I felt a sort of tender curiosityTe bored haughty face that she turned to the world con-cealed something most afectations conceal somethingeventually even though they don t in the beginning andone day I found what it was When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick she lef a borrowed car outin the rain with the top down and then lied about it andsuddenly I remembered the story about her that had eludedme that night at Daisy s At her frst big golf tournamentthere was a row that nearly reached the newspapers a sug-gestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in thesemi-fnal round Te thing approached the proportions ofa scandal then died away A caddy retracted his statementand the only other witness admitted that he might havebeen mistaken Te incident and the name had remainedtogether in my mind

Her grey sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead butshe had deliberately shifed our relations and for a momentI thought I loved her But I am slow-thinking and full ofinterior rules that act as brakes on my desires and I knewthat frst I had to get myself defnitely out of that tangleback home I d been writing letters once a week and signing    The Great Gatsbythem  Love Nick  and all I could think of was how whenthat certain girl played tennis a faint mustache of perspi-ration appeared on her upper lip Nevertheless there was avague understanding that had to be tactfully broken of be-fore I was free

Good morning old sport You re having lunch with metoday and I thought we d ride up together
He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his carwith that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarlyAmerican that comes I suppose with the absence of lif-ing work or rigid sitting in youth and even more with theformless grace of our nervous sporadic games Tis qualitywas continually breaking through his punctilious mannerin the shape of restlessness He was never quite still therewas always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient open-ing and closing of a hand
He saw me looking with admiration at his car It s pretty isn t it old sport  He jumped of to give me abetter view  Haven t you ever seen it before
I d seen it Everybody had seen it It was a rich creamcolor bright with nickel swollen here and there in its mon-strous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxesand tool-boxes and terraced with a labyrinth of windshieldsthat mirrored a dozen suns Sitting down behind many lay-ers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we startedto town
I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in thepast month and found to my disappointment that he hadlittle to say So my frst impression that he was a personof some undefned consequence had gradually faded andFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate road-house next door
And then came that disconcerting ride We hadn treached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving hiselegant sentences unfnished and slapping himself indeci-sively on the knee of his caramel-colored suit
Look here old sport  he broke out surprisingly  What syour opinion of me anyhow
A little overwhelmed I began the generalized evasionswhich that question deserves
Well I m going to tell you something about my life he interrupted  I don t want you to get a wrong idea of mefrom all these stories you hear
So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that favoredconversation in his halls
I ll tell you God s truth  His right hand suddenly or-dered divine retribution to stand by  I am the son of somewealthy people in the middle-west all dead now I wasbrought up in America but educated at Oxford because allmy ancestors have been educated there for many years It isa family tradition
He looked at me sideways and I knew why Jordan Bakerhad believed he was lying He hurried the phrase  educatedat Oxford  or swallowed it or choked on it as though it hadbothered him before And with this doubt his whole state-ment fell to pieces and I wondered if there wasn t somethinga little sinister about him afer all
What part of the middle-west  I inquired casually San Francisco
0    The Great Gatsby   I see
My family all died and I came into a good deal of mon-ey
His voice was solemn as if the memory of that sud-den extinction of a clan still haunted him For a momentI suspected that he was pulling my leg but a glance at himconvinced me otherwise

It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazersloafng in an archway through which were visible a host ofspires Tere was Gatsby looking a little not much young-er with a cricket bat in his hand
Ten it was all true I saw the skins of tigers faming inhis palace on the Grand Canal I saw him opening a chest ofrubies to ease with their crimson-lighted depths the gnaw-ings of his broken heart
I m going to make a big request of you today  he saidpocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction  so I thought you    The Great Gatsbyought to know something about me I didn t want you tothink I was just some nobody You see I usually fnd my-self among strangers because I drif here and there tryingto forget the sad thing that happened to me  He hesitated You ll hear about it this afernoon
At lunch
No this afernoon I happened to fnd out that you retaking Miss Baker to tea
Do you mean you re in love with Miss Baker  No old sport I m not But Miss Baker has kindly con-sented to speak to you about this matter
I hadn t the faintest idea what  this matter  was but I wasmore annoyed than interested I hadn t asked Jordan to teain order to discuss Mr Jay Gatsby I was sure the requestwould be something utterly fantastic and for a moment Iwas sorry I d ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawnHe wouldn t say another word His correctness grew onhim as we neared the city We passed Port Roosevelt wherethere was a glimpse of red-belted ocean-going ships andsped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark undesertedsaloons of the faded gilt nineteen-hundreds Ten the valleyof ashes opened out on both sides of us and I had a glimpseof Mrs Wilson straining at the garage pump with pantingvitality as we went by

A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with bloomsfollowed by two carriages with drawn blinds and by morecheerful carriages for friends Te friends looked out at uswith the tragic eyes and short upper lips of south-easternEurope and I was glad that the sight of Gatsby s splendidcar was included in their somber holiday As we crossedBlackwell s Island a limousine passed us driven by a whitechaufeur in which sat three modish Negroes two bucksand a girl I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballsrolled toward us in haughty rivalry
Anything can happen now that we ve slid over thisbridge  I thought  anything at all 
Even Gatsby could happen without any particular won-der
Roaring noon In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cel-    The Great Gatsbylar I met Gatsby for lunch Blinking away the brightness ofthe street outside my eyes picked him out obscurely in theanteroom talking to another man
Mr Carraway this is my friend Mr Wolfshiem A small fat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regard-ed me with two fne growths of hair which luxuriated ineither nostril Afer a moment I discovered his tiny eyes inthe half darkness
so I took one look at him   said Mr Wolfshiem shak-ing my hand earnestly   and what do you think I did  What  I inquired politely
But evidently he was not addressing me for he droppedmy hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive nose I handed the money to Katspaugh and I sid  All rightKatspaugh don t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth He shut it then and there
Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forwardinto the restaurant whereupon Mr Wolfshiem swallowed anew sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambu-latory abstraction
Highballs  asked the head waiter
Tis is a nice restaurant here  said Mr Wolfshiem look-ing at the Presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling  But I likeacross the street better
Yes highballs  agreed Gatsby and then to Mr Wolf-shiem  It s too hot over there
Hot and small yes  said Mr Wolfshiem  but full ofmemories
What place is that  I asked
Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom       Te old Metropole
Te old Metropole  brooded Mr Wolfshiem gloomily Filled with faces dead and gone Filled with friends gonenow forever I can t forget so long as I live the night theyshot Rosy Rosenthal there It was six of us at the table andRosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening When it was al-most morning the waiter came up to him with a funnylook and says somebody wants to speak to him outside  Allright  says Rosy and begins to get up and I pulled him downin his chair
Let the bastards come in here if they want you Rosybut don t you so help me move outside this room  It was four o clock in the morning then and if we d ofraised the blinds we d of seen daylight
Did he go  I asked innocently
Sure he went  Mr Wolfshiem s nose fashed at me in-dignantly  He turned around in the door and says  Don tlet that waiter take away my cofee  Ten he went out onthe sidewalk and they shot him three times in his full bellyand drove away
Four of them were electrocuted  I said remembering Five with Becker  His nostrils turned to me in an in-terested way  I understand you re looking for a businessgonnegtion
Te juxtaposition of these two remarks was startlingGatsby answered for me
Oh no  he exclaimed  this isn t the man
No  Mr Wolfshiem seemed disappointed
Tis is just a friend I told you we d talk about that some    The Great Gatsbyother time
I beg your pardon  said Mr Wolfshiem  I had a wrongman
A succulent hash arrived and Mr Wolfshiem forget-ting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropolebegan to eat with ferocious delicacy His eyes meanwhileroved very slowly all around the room he completed thearc by turning to inspect the people directly behind I thinkthat except for my presence he would have taken one shortglance beneath our own table
Look here old sport  said Gatsby leaning toward me I m afraid I made you a little angry this morning in thecar
Tere was the smile again but this time I held out againstit
I don t like mysteries  I answered  And I don t under-stand why you won t come out frankly and tell me what youwant Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker  Oh it s nothing underhand  he assured me  Miss Bak-er s a great sportswoman you know and she d never doanything that wasn t all right
Suddenly he looked at his watch jumped up and hurriedfrom the room leaving me with Mr Wolfshiem at the table He has to telephone  said Mr Wolfshiem following himwith his eyes  Fine fellow isn t he Handsome to look at anda perfect gentleman
Yes
He s an Oggsford man
Oh
Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom       He went to Oggsford College in England You knowOggsford College
I ve heard of it
It s one of the most famous colleges in the world  Have you known Gatsby for a long time  I inquired Several years  he answered in a gratifed way  I madethe pleasure of his acquaintance just afer the war But Iknew I had discovered a man of fne breeding afer I talkedwith him an hour I said to myself  Tere s the kind of manyou d like to take home and introduce to your mother andsister    He paused  I see you re looking at my cuf buttons I hadn t been looking at them but I did now Tey werecomposed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory
Finest specimens of human molars  he informed me Well  I inspected them  Tat s a very interesting idea  Yeah  He fipped his sleeves up under his coat  YeahGatsby s very careful about women He would never somuch as look at a friend s wife
When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to thetable and sat down Mr Wolfshiem drank his cofee with ajerk and got to his feet
I have enjoyed my lunch  he said  and I m going to runof from you two young men before I outstay my welcome  Don t hurry Meyer  said Gatsby without enthusiasmMr Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction You re very polite but I belong to another generation  heannounced solemnly  You sit here and discuss your sportsand your young ladies and your    He supplied an imagi-nary noun with another wave of his hand  As for me I am    The Great Gatsbyffy years old and I won t impose myself on you any lon-ger
As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose wastrembling I wondered if I had said anything to ofend him He becomes very sentimental sometimes  explainedGatsby  Tis is one of his sentimental days He s quite acharacter around New York a denizen of Broadway  Who is he anyhow an actor
No
A dentist
Meyer Wolfshiem No he s a gambler  Gatsby hesitatedthen added coolly  He s the man who fxed the World s Se-ries back in 1919
Fixed the World s Series  I repeated
Te idea staggered me I remembered of course that theWorld s Series had been fxed in 1919 but if I had thoughtof it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that mere-ly HAPPENED the end of some inevitable chain It neveroccurred to me that one man could start to play with thefaith of ffy million people with the single-mindedness ofa burglar blowing a safe
How did he happen to do that  I asked afer a minute He just saw the opportunity
Why isn t he in jail
Tey can t get him old sport He s a smart man I insisted on paying the check As the waiter brought mychange I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowdedroom
Come along with me for a minute  I said  I ve got to sayFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    hello to someone
When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozensteps in our direction
Where ve you been  he demanded eagerly  Daisy s furi-ous because you haven t called up
Tis is Mr Gatsby Mr Buchanan
Tey shook hands briefy and a strained unfamiliar lookof embarrassment came over Gatsby s face
How ve you been anyhow  demanded Tom of me How d you happen to come up this far to eat
I ve been having lunch with Mr Gatsby
I turned toward Mr Gatsby but he was no longer thereOne October day in nineteen-seventeen   said JordanBaker that afernoon sitting up very straight on a straightchair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel  I was walk-ing along from one place to another half on the sidewalksand half on the lawns I was happier on the lawns because Ihad on shoes from England with rubber nobs on the solesthat bit into the sof ground I had on a new plaid skirt alsothat blew a little in the wind and whenever this happenedthe red white and blue banners in front of all the housesstretched out stif and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT in a disap-proving way
Te largest of the banners and the largest of the lawnsbelonged to Daisy Fay s house She was just eighteen twoyears older than me and by far the most popular of all theyoung girls in Louisville She dressed in white and had alittle white roadster and all day long the telephone rangin her house and excited young ofcers from Camp Tay-0    The Great Gatsbylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night anyways for an hour
When I came opposite her house that morning her whiteroadster was beside the curb and she was sitting in it with alieutenant I had never seen before Tey were so engrossedin each other that she didn t see me until I was fve feetaway
Hello Jordan  she called unexpectedly  Please comehere
I was fattered that she wanted to speak to me becauseof all the older girls I admired her most She asked me if Iwas going to the Red Cross and make bandages I was Wellthen would I tell them that she couldn t come that day Teofcer looked at Daisy while she was speaking in a waythat every young girl wants to be looked at sometime andbecause it seemed romantic to me I have remembered theincident ever since His name was Jay Gatsby and I didn tlay eyes on him again for over four years even afer I d methim on Long Island I didn t realize it was the same manTat was nineteen-seventeen By the next year I had afew beaux myself and I began to play in tournaments soI didn t see Daisy very ofen She went with a slightly old-er crowd when she went with anyone at all Wild rumorswere circulating about her how her mother had found herpacking her bag one winter night to go to New York and saygoodbye to a soldier who was going overseas She was efec-tually prevented but she wasn t on speaking terms with herfamily for several weeks Afer that she didn t play aroundwith the soldiers any more but only with a few fat-footedFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1short-sighted young men in town who couldn t get into thearmy at all
By the next autumn she was gay again gay as ever Shehad a debut afer the Armistice and in February she waspresumably engaged to a man from New Orleans In Juneshe married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with more pompand circumstance than Louisville ever knew before Hecame down with a hundred people in four private cars andhired a whole foor of the Seelbach Hotel and the day beforethe wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at threehundred and ffy thousand dollars
I was bridesmaid I came into her room half an hour be-fore the bridal dinner and found her lying on her bed aslovely as the June night in her fowered dress and as drunkas a monkey She had a bottle of sauterne in one hand and aletter in the other
Gratulate me  she muttered  Never had a drink beforebut oh how I do enjoy it
What s the matter Daisy
I was scared I can tell you I d never seen a girl like thatbefore
Here dearis  She groped around in a waste-basket shehad with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls Take  em downstairs and give  em back to whoever theybelong to Tell  em all Daisy s change  her mine Say  Daisy schange  her mine 
She began to cry she cried and cried I rushed out andfound her mother s maid and we locked the door and gother into a cold bath She wouldn t let go of the letter She    The Great Gatsbytook it into the tub with her and squeezed it up into a wetball and only let me leave it in the soap dish when she sawthat it was coming to pieces like snow
But she didn t say another word We gave her spirits ofammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her backinto her dress and half an hour later when we walked out ofthe room the pearls were around her neck and the incidentwas over Next day at fve o clock she married Tom Buchan-an without so much as a shiver and started of on a threemonths  trip to the South Seas
I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back andI thought I d never seen a girl so mad about her husbandIf he lef the room for a minute she d look around uneasilyand say  Where s Tom gone  and wear the most abstract-ed expression until she saw him coming in the door Sheused to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hourrubbing her fngers over his eyes and looking at him withunfathomable delight It was touching to see them togeth-er it made you laugh in a hushed fascinated way Tat wasin August A week afer I lef Santa Barbara Tom ran intoa wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped a frontwheel of his car Te girl who was with him got into the pa-pers too because her arm was broken she was one of thechambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel
Te next April Daisy had her little girl and they went toFrance for a year I saw them one spring in Cannes and laterin Deauville and then they came back to Chicago to settledown Daisy was popular in Chicago as you know Teymoved with a fast crowd all of them young and rich andFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    wild but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputationPerhaps because she doesn t drink It s a great advantage notto drink among hard-drinking people You can hold yourtongue and moreover you can time any little irregulari-ty of your own so that everybody else is so blind that theydon t see or care Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour atall and yet there s something in that voice of hers Well about six weeks ago she heard the name Gatsby forthe frst time in years It was when I asked you do you re-member if you knew Gatsby in West Egg Afer you hadgone home she came into my room and woke me up andsaid  What Gatsby  and when I described him I was halfasleep she said in the strangest voice that it must be theman she used to know It wasn t until then that I connectedthis Gatsby with the ofcer in her white car
When Jordan Baker had fnished telling all this we hadlef the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a Victoriathrough Central Park Te sun had gone down behind thetall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifies andthe clear voices of girls already gathered like crickets on thegrass rose through the hot twilight
I m the Sheik of Araby
Your love belongs to me
At night when you re are asleep
Into your tent I ll creep
It was a strange coincidence  I said
But it wasn t a coincidence at all
The Great Gatsby   Why not
Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be justacross the bay
Ten it had not been merely the stars to which he hadaspired on that June night He came alive to me deliveredsuddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendor He wants to know   continued Jordan   if you ll in-vite Daisy to your house some afernoon and then let himcome over
Te modesty of the demand shook me He had waitedfve years and bought a mansion where he dispensed star-light to casual moths so that he could  come over  someafernoon to a stranger s garden
Did I have to know all this before he could ask such alittle thing
He s afraid He s waited so long He thought you mightbe ofended You see he s a regular tough underneath it all Something worried me
Why didn t he ask you to arrange a meeting  He wants her to see his house  she explained  And yourhouse is right next door
Oh
I think he half expected her to wander into one of hisparties some night  went on Jordan  but she never didTen he began asking people casually if they knew her andI was the frst one he found It was that night he sent for meat his dance and you should have heard the elaborate wayhe worked up to it Of course I immediately suggested aluncheon in New York and I thought he d go madFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom         I don t want to do anything out of the way  he kept say-ing  I want to see her right next door
When I said you were a particular friend of Tom s hestarted to abandon the whole idea He doesn t know verymuch about Tom though he says he s read a Chicago paperfor years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisy sname
It was dark now and as we dipped under a little bridgeI put my arm around Jordan s golden shoulder and drewher toward me and asked her to dinner Suddenly I wasn tthinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more but of this cleanhard limited person who dealt in universal skepticism andwho leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm Aphrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excite-ment  Tere are only the pursued the pursuing the busyand the tired
And Daisy ought to have something in her life  mur-mured Jordan to me
Does she want to see Gatsby
She s not to know about it Gatsby doesn t want her toknow You re just supposed to invite her to tea We passed a barrier of dark trees and then the facadeof Fify-ninth Street a block of delicate pale light beameddown into the park Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan Ihad no girl whose disembodied face foated along the darkcornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the girl besideme tightening my arms Her wan scornful mouth smiledand so I drew her up again closer this time to my face    The Great GatsbyChapter 5
Wfhoern  I  caommee hto tmhea t o Wy est Eseg g tahsa t nn ifgrhet I wa s a flroaidand the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with lightwhich fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongat-ing glints upon the roadside wires Turning a corner I sawthat it was Gatsby s house lit from tower to cellarAt frst I thought it was another party a wild rout thathad resolved itself into  hide-and-go-seek  or  sardines-in-the-box  with all the house thrown open to the game Butthere wasn t a sound Only wind in the trees which blew thewires and made the lights go of and on again as if the househad winked into the darkness As my taxi groaned away Isaw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn Your place looks like the world s fair  I said Does it  He turned his eyes toward it absently  I havebeen glancing into some of the rooms Let s go to Coney Is-land old sport In my car
It s too late
Well suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool Ihaven t made use of it all summer
I ve got to go to bed
All right
He waited looking at me with suppressed eagerness I talked with Miss Baker  I said afer a moment  I m go-Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    ing to call up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here totea
Oh that s all right  he said carelessly  I don t want to putyou to any trouble
What day would suit you
What day would suit YOU  he corrected me quickly  Idon t want to put you to any trouble you see
How about the day afer tomorrow  He considered for amoment Ten with reluctance
I want to get the grass cut  he said
We both looked at the grass there was a sharp linewhere my ragged lawn ended and the darker well-kept ex-panse of his began I suspected that he meant my grass Tere s another little thing  he said uncertainly andhesitated
Would you rather put it of for a few days  I asked Oh it isn t about that At least    He fumbled with aseries of beginnings  Why I thought why look here oldsport you don t make much money do you
Not very much
Tis seemed to reassure him and he continued moreconfdently
I thought you didn t if you ll pardon my you seeI carry on a little business on the side a sort of sidelineyou understand And I thought that if you don t make verymuch You re selling bonds aren t you old sport  Trying to
Well this would interest you It wouldn t take up muchof your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money It    The Great Gatsbyhappens to be a rather confdential sort of thing I realize now that under diferent circumstances thatconversation might have been one of the crises of my lifeBut because the ofer was obviously and tactlessly for a ser-vice to be rendered I had no choice except to cut him ofthere
I ve got my hands full  I said  I m much obliged but Icouldn t take on any more work
You wouldn t have to do any business with Wolfshiem Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the  gon-negtion  mentioned at lunch but I assured him he waswrong He waited a moment longer hoping I d begin a con-versation but I was too absorbed to be responsive so hewent unwillingly home
Te evening had made me light-headed and happy Ithink I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front doorSo I didn t know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Is-land or for how many hours he  glanced into rooms  whilehis house blazed gaudily on I called up Daisy from the of-fce next morning and invited her to come to tea Don t bring Tom  I warned her
What
Don t bring Tom
Who is  Tom   she asked innocently
Te day agreed upon was pouring rain At eleven o clocka man in a raincoat dragging a lawn-mower tapped at myfront door and said that Mr Gatsby had sent him over tocut my grass Tis reminded me that I had forgotten to tellmy Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg Village toFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    search for her among soggy white-washed alleys and to buysome cups and lemons and fowers
Te fowers were unnecessary for at two o clock a green-house arrived from Gatsby s with innumerable receptaclesto contain it An hour later the front door opened nervouslyand Gatsby in a white fannel suit silver shirt and gold-col-ored tie hurried in He was pale and there were dark signs ofsleeplessness beneath his eyes
Is everything all right  he asked immediately Te grass looks fne if that s what you mean  What grass  he inquired blankly  Oh the grass in theyard  He looked out the window at it but judging from hisexpression I don t believe he saw a thing
Looks very good  he remarked vaguely  One of thepapers said they thought the rain would stop about fourI think it was  Te Journal  Have you got everything youneed in the shape of of tea
I took him into the pantry where he looked a little re-proachfully at the Finn Together we scrutinized the twelvelemon cakes from the delicatessen shop
Will they do  I asked
Of course of course Tey re fne  and he added hol-lowly   old sport
Te rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mistthrough which occasional thin drops swam like dew Gatsbylooked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay s  Econom-ics  starting at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchenfoor and peering toward the bleared windows from time totime as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were0    The Great Gatsbytaking place outside Finally he got up and informed me inan uncertain voice that he was going home
Why s that
Nobody s coming to tea It s too late  He looked at hiswatch as if there was some pressing demand on his timeelsewhere  I can t wait all day
Don t be silly it s just two minutes to four
He sat down miserably as if I had pushed him and si-multaneously there was the sound of a motor turning intomy lane We both jumped up and a little harrowed myselfI went out into the yard
Under the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car wascoming up the drive It stopped Daisy s face tipped side-ways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat looked out atme with a bright ecstatic smile
Is this absolutely where you live my dearest one Te exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic inthe rain I had to follow the sound of it for a moment up anddown with my ear alone before any words came through Adamp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across hercheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I tookit to help her from the car
Are you in love with me  she said low in my ear  Or whydid I have to come alone
Tat s the secret of Castle Rackrent Tell your chaufeurto go far away and spend an hour
Come back in an hour Ferdie  Ten in a grave murmur His name is Ferdie

Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1   I don t think so  she said innocently  Why We went in To my overwhelming surprise the livingroom was deserted
Well that s funny  I exclaimed
What s funny
She turned her head as there was a light dignifed knock-ing at the front door I went out and opened it Gatsby paleas death with his hands plunged like weights in his coatpockets was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragi-cally into my eyes
With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by meinto the hall turned sharply as if he were on a wire and dis-appeared into the living room It wasn t a bit funny Awareof the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door toagainst the increasing rain
For half a minute there wasn t a sound Ten from theliving room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of alaugh followed by Daisy s voice on a clear artifcial note I certainly am awfully glad to see you again A pause it endured horribly I had nothing to do in thehall so I went into the room
Gatsby his hands still in his pockets was recliningagainst the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfectease even of boredom His head leaned back so far that itrested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock andfrom this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisywho was sitting frightened but graceful on the edge of a stifchair
We ve met before  muttered Gatsby His eyes glanced    The Great Gatsbymomentarily at me and his lips parted with an abortiveattempt at a laugh Luckily the clock took this moment totilt dangerously at the pressure of his head whereupon heturned and caught it with trembling fngers and set it backin place Ten he sat down rigidly his elbow on the arm ofthe sofa and his chin in his hand
I m sorry about the clock  he said
My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn Icouldn t muster up a single commonplace out of the thou-sand in my head
It s an old clock  I told them idiotically
I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashedin pieces on the foor
We haven t met for many years  said Daisy her voice asmatter-of-fact as it could ever be
Five years next November
Te automatic quality of Gatsby s answer set us all backat least another minute I had them both on their feet withthe desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in thekitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a trayAmid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a cer-tain physical decency established itself Gatsby got himselfinto a shadow and while Daisy and I talked looked consci-entiously from one to the other of us with tense unhappyeyes However as calmness wasn t an end in itself I made anexcuse at the frst possible moment and got to my feet Where are you going  demanded Gatsby in immediatealarm
I ll be back
Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom       I ve got to speak to you about something before you go He followed me wildly into the kitchen closed the doorand whispered  Oh God  in a miserable way
What s the matter
Tis is a terrible mistake  he said shaking his head fromside to side  a terrible terrible mistake
You re just embarrassed that s all  and luckily I added Daisy s embarrassed too
She s embarrassed  he repeated incredulously Just as much as you are
Don t talk so loud
You re acting like a little boy  I broke out impatiently Not only that but you re rude Daisy s sitting in there allalone
He raised his hand to stop my words looked at me withunforgettable reproach and opening the door cautiouslywent back into the other room
I walked out the back way just as Gatsby had when hehad made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour be-fore and ran for a huge black knotted tree whose massedleaves made a fabric against the rain Once more it waspouring and my irregular lawn well-shaved by Gatsby sgardener abounded in small muddy swamps and prehis-toric marshes Tere was nothing to look at from underthe tree except Gatsby s enormous house so I stared at itlike Kant at his church steeple for half an hour A brewerhad built it early in the  period  craze a decade before andthere was a story that he d agreed to pay fve years  taxeson all the neighboring cottages if the owners would have    The Great Gatsbytheir roofs thatched with straw Perhaps their refusal tookthe heart out of his plan to Found a Family he went intoan immediate decline His children sold his house with theblack wreath still on the door Americans while occasion-ally willing to be serfs have always been obstinate aboutbeing peasantry
Afer half an hour the sun shone again and the grocer sautomobile rounded Gatsby s drive with the raw materialfor his servants  dinner I felt sure he wouldn t eat a spoon-ful A maid began opening the upper windows of his houseappeared momentarily in each and leaning from a largecentral bay spat meditatively into the garden It was time Iwent back While the rain continued it had seemed like themurmur of their voices rising and swelling a little now andthe with gusts of emotion But in the new silence I felt thatsilence had fallen within the house too
I went in afer making every possible noise in the kitch-en short of pushing over the stove but I don t believe theyheard a sound Tey were sitting at either end of the couchlooking at each other as if some question had been askedor was in the air and every vestige of embarrassment wasgone Daisy s face was smeared with tears and when I camein she jumped up and began wiping at it with her hand-kerchief before a mirror But there was a change in Gatsbythat was simply confounding He literally glowed withouta word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiatedfrom him and flled the little room
Oh hello old sport  he said as if he hadn t seen mefor years I thought for a moment he was going to shakeFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    hands
It s stopped raining
Has it  When he realized what I was talking about thatthere were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room he smiledlike a weather man like an ecstatic patron of recurrent lightand repeated the news to Daisy  What do you think of thatIt s stopped raining
I m glad Jay  Her throat full of aching grieving beautytold only of her unexpected joy
I want you and Daisy to come over to my house  he said I d like to show her around
You re sure you want me to come
Absolutely old sport
Daisy went upstairs to wash her face too late I thoughtwith humiliation of my towels while Gatsby and I waitedon the lawn
My house looks well doesn t it  he demanded  See howthe whole front of it catches the light
I agreed that it was splendid
Yes  His eyes went over it every arched door and squaretower  It took me just three years to earn the money thatbought it
I thought you inherited your money
I did old sport  he said automatically  but I lost most ofit in the big panic the panic of the war
I think he hardly knew what he was saying for when Iasked him what business he was in he answered  Tat s myafair  before he realized that it wasn t the appropriate re-ply
The Great Gatsby   Oh I ve been in several things  he corrected himself  Iwas in the drug business and then I was in the oil businessBut I m not in either one now  He looked at me with moreattention  Do you mean you ve been thinking over what Iproposed the other night
Before I could answer Daisy came out of the house andtwo rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sun-light
Tat huge place THERE  she cried pointing Do you like it
I love it but I don t see how you live there all alone  I keep it always full of interesting people night and dayPeople who do interesting things Celebrated people Instead of taking the short cut along the Sound we wentdown the road and entered by the big postern With en-chanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of thefeudal silhouette against the sky admired the gardens thesparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthornand plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate It was strange to reach the marble steps and fndno stir of bright dresses in and out the door and hear nosound but bird voices in the trees
And inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinettemusic rooms and Restoration salons I felt that there wereguests concealed behind every couch and table under or-ders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed throughAs Gatsby closed the door of  the Merton College Library I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break intoghostly laughter
Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom      We went upstairs through period bedrooms swathed inrose and lavender silk and vivid with new fowers throughdressing rooms and poolrooms and bathrooms with sunk-en baths intruding into one chamber where a dishevelledman in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the foor Itwas Mr Klipspringer the  boarder  I had seen him wander-ing hungrily about the beach that morning Finally we cameto Gatsby s own apartment a bedroom and a bath and anAdam study where we sat down and drank a glass of someChartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wallHe hadn t once ceased looking at Daisy and I think herevalued everything in his house according to the measureof response it drew from her well-loved eyes Sometimestoo he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way asthough in her actual and astounding presence none of itwas any longer real Once he nearly toppled down a fightof stairs
His bedroom was the simplest room of all except wherethe dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull goldDaisy took the brush with delight and smoothed her hairwhereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and beganto laugh
It s the funniest thing old sport  he said hilariously  Ican t when I try to
He had passed visibly through two states and was en-tering upon a third Afer his embarrassment and hisunreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her pres-ence He had been full of the idea so long dreamed it rightthrough to the end waited with his teeth set so to speak at    The Great Gatsbyan inconceivable pitch of intensity Now in the reaction hewas running down like an overwound clock
Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us twohulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits anddressing-gowns and ties and his shirts piled like bricks instacks a dozen high
I ve got a man in England who buys me clothes He sendsover a selection of things at the beginning of each seasonspring and fall
He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them oneby one before us shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fnefannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the ta-ble in many-colored disarray While we admired he broughtmore and the sof rich heap mounted higher shirts withstripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green andlavender and faint orange with monograms of Indian blueSuddenly with a strained sound Daisy bent her head intothe shirts and began to cry stormily
Tey re such beautiful shirts  she sobbed her voice muf-fed in the thick folds  It makes me sad because I ve neverseen such such beautiful shirts before
Afer the house we were to see the grounds and theswimming pool and the hydroplane and the midsummerfowers but outside Gatsby s window it began to rain againso we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface ofthe Sound
If it wasn t for the mist we could see your home acrossthe bay  said Gatsby  You always have a green light thatburns all night at the end of your dock
Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom      Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemedabsorbed in what he had just said Possibly it had occurredto him that the colossal signifcance of that light had nowvanished forever Compared to the great distance that hadseparated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to heralmost touching her It had seemed as close as a star to themoon Now it was again a green light on a dock His countof enchanted objects had diminished by one
I began to walk about the room examining various in-defnite objects in the half darkness A large photograph ofan elderly man in yachting costume attracted me hung onthe wall over his desk
Who s this
Tat Tat s Mr Dan Cody old sport
Te name sounded faintly familiar
He s dead now He used to be my best friend years ago Tere was a small picture of Gatsby also in yachting cos-tume on the bureau Gatsby with his head thrown backdefantly taken apparently when he was about eighteen I adore it  exclaimed Daisy  Te pompadour You nevertold me you had a pompadour or a yacht
Look at this  said Gatsby quickly  Here s a lot of clip-pings about you
Tey stood side by side examining it I was going to askto see the rubies when the phone rang and Gatsby took upthe receiver
Yes  Well I can t talk now  I can t talk now oldsport  I said a SMALL town  He must know what asmall town is  Well he s no use to us if Detroit is his idea100    The Great Gatsbyof a small town 
He rang of
Come here QUICK  cried Daisy at the windowTe rain was still falling but the darkness had parted inthe west and there was a pink and golden billow of foamyclouds above the sea
Look at that  she whispered and then afer a moment I d like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in itand push you around
I tried to go then but they wouldn t hear of it perhapsmy presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone I know what we ll do  said Gatsby  we ll have Klip-springer play the piano
He went out of the room calling  Ewing  and returnedin a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed slight-ly worn young man with shell-rimmed glasses and scantyblonde hair He was now decently clothed in a  sport shirt open at the neck sneakers and duck trousers of a nebuloushue
Did we interrupt your exercises  inquired Daisy polite-ly
I was asleep  cried Mr Klipspringer in a spasm of em-barrassment  Tat is I d BEEN asleep Ten I got up   Klipspringer plays the piano  said Gatsby cutting himof  Don t you Ewing old sport

In the music room Gatsby turned on a solitary lampbeside the piano He lit Daisy s cigarette from a tremblingmatch and sat down with her on a couch far across theroom where there was no light save what the gleaming foorbounced in from the hall
When Klipspringer had played  Te Love Nest  he turnedaround on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby inthe gloom

Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint fowof thunder along the Sound All the lights were going onin West Egg now the electric trains men-carrying wereplunging home through the rain from New York It was thehour of a profound human change and excitement was gen-erating on the air

10    The Great Gatsby  IN BETWEEN TIME
As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression ofbewilderment had come back into Gatsby s face as thougha faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of hispresent happiness Almost fve years Tere must have beenmoments even that afernoon when Daisy tumbled shortof his dreams not through her own fault but because ofthe colossal vitality of his illusion It had gone beyond herbeyond everything He had thrown himself into it with acreative passion adding to it all the time decking it outwith every bright feather that drifed his way No amountof fre or freshness can challenge what a man will store upin his ghostly heart
As I watched him he adjusted himself a little visiblyHis hand took hold of hers and as she said something lowin his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion Ithink that voice held him most with its fuctuating feverishwarmth because it couldn t be over-dreamed that voicewas a deathless song
Tey had forgotten me but Daisy glanced up and heldout her hand Gatsby didn t know me now at all I lookedonce more at them and they looked back at me remotelypossessed by intense life Ten I went out of the room anddown the marble steps into the rain leaving them there to-gether

Anything to say about what  inquired Gatsby politely Why any statement to give out
It transpired afer a confused fve minutes that the manhad heard Gatsby s name around his ofce in a connectionwhich he either wouldn t reveal or didn t fully understandTis was his day of and with laudable initiative he had hur-ried out  to see
It was a random shot and yet the reporter s instinct wasright Gatsby s notoriety spread about by the hundreds whohad accepted his hospitality and so become authorities onhis past had increased all summer until he fell just shortof being news Contemporary legends such as the  under-ground pipe-line to Canada  attached themselves to himand there was one persistent story that he didn t live in ahouse at all but in a boat that looked like a house and wasmoved secretly up and down the Long Island shore Justwhy these inventions were a source of satisfaction to JamesGatz of North Dakota isn t easy to say
James Gatz that was really or at least legally his nameHe had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specifcmoment that witnessed the beginning of his career when10    The Great Gatsbyhe saw Dan Cody s yacht drop anchor over the most insidi-ous fat on Lake Superior It was James Gatz who had beenloafng along the beach that afernoon in a torn green jer-sey and a pair of canvas pants but it was already Jay Gatsbywho borrowed a row-boat pulled out to the TUOLOMEEand informed Cody that a wind might catch him and breakhim up in half an hour
I suppose he d had the name ready for a long time eventhen His parents were shifless and unsuccessful farm peo-ple his imagination had never really accepted them ashis parents at all Te truth was that Jay Gatsby of WestEgg Long Island sprang from his Platonic conception ofhimself He was a son of God a phrase which if it meansanything means just that and he must be about HisFather s Business the service of a vast vulgar and meretri-cious beauty So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby thata seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent and tothis conception he was faithful to the end
For over a year he had been beating his way along thesouth shore of Lake Superior as a clam digger and a salmonfsher or in any other capacity that brought him food andbed His brown hardening body lived naturally throughthe half ferce half lazy work of the bracing days He knewwomen early and since they spoiled him he became con-temptuous of them of young virgins because they wereignorant of the others because they were hysterical aboutthings which in his overwhelming self-absorption he tookfor granted
But his heart was in a constant turbulent riot Te mostFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    10grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed atnight A universe of inefable gaudiness spun itself out inhis brain while the clock ticked on the wash-stand and themoon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon thefoor Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies un-til drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with anoblivious embrace For a while these reveries provided anoutlet for his imagination they were a satisfactory hint ofthe unreality of reality a promise that the rock of the worldwas founded securely on a fairy s wing
An instinct toward his future glory had led him somemonths before to the small Lutheran college of St Olaf insouthern Minnesota He stayed there two weeks dismayedat its ferocious indiference to the drums of his destiny todestiny itself and despising the janitor s work with whichhe was to pay his way through Ten he drifed back to LakeSuperior and he was still searching for something to do onthe day that Dan Cody s yacht dropped anchor in the shal-lows along shore
Cody was ffy years old then a product of the Nevadasilver felds of the Yukon of every rush for metal since Sev-enty-fve Te transactions in Montana copper that madehim many times a millionaire found him physically robustbut on the verge of sof-mindedness and suspecting thisan infnite number of women tried to separate him fromhis money Te none too savory ramifcations by which EllaKaye the newspaper woman played Madame de Main-tenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht werecommon knowledge to the turgid journalism of 1902 He10    The Great Gatsbyhad been coasting along all too hospitable shores for fveyears when he turned up as James Gatz s destiny at LittleGirl Bay
To the young Gatz resting on his oars and looking upat the railed deck the yacht represented all the beauty andglamor in the world I suppose he smiled at Cody he hadprobably discovered that people liked him when he smiledAt any rate Cody asked him a few questions one of themelicited the brand new name and found that he was quickand extravagantly ambitious A few days later he took himto Duluth and bought him a blue coat six pair of white ducktrousers and a yachting cap And when the TUOLOMEElef for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast Gatsby leftoo
He was employed in a vague personal capacity whilehe remained with Cody he was in turn steward mate skip-per secretary and even jailor for Dan Cody sober knewwhat lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be aboutand he provided for such contingencies by reposing moreand more trust in Gatsby Te arrangement lasted fve yearsduring which the boat went three times around the con-tinent It might have lasted indefnitely except for the factthat Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and aweek later Dan Cody inhospitably died
I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby s bedrooma grey forid man with a hard empty face the pioneer de-bauchee who during one phase of American life broughtback to the eastern seaboard the savage violence of the fron-tier brothel and saloon It was indirectly due to Cody thatFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    10Gatsby drank so little Sometimes in the course of gay par-ties women used to rub champagne into his hair for himselfhe formed the habit of letting liquor alone
And it was from Cody that he inherited money a legacyof twenty-fve thousand dollars He didn t get it He nev-er understood the legal device that was used against himbut what remained of the millions went intact to Ella KayeHe was lef with his singularly appropriate education thevague contour of Jay Gatsby had flled out to the substanti-ality of a man
He told me all this very much later but I ve put it downhere with the idea of exploding those frst wild rumors abouthis antecedents which weren t even faintly true Moreoverhe told it to me at a time of confusion when I had reachedthe point of believing everything and nothing about himSo I take advantage of this short halt while Gatsby so tospeak caught his breath to clear this set of misconceptionsaway
It was a halt too in my association with his afairsFor several weeks I didn t see him or hear his voice on thephone mostly I was in New York trotting around withJordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt but fnally I went over to his house one Sunday afernoonI hadn t been there two minutes when somebody broughtTom Buchanan in for a drink I was startled naturally butthe really surprising thing was that it hadn t happened be-fore
Tey were a party of three on horseback Tom and aman named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding10    The Great Gatsbyhabit who had been there previously
I m delighted to see you  said Gatsby standing on hisporch  I m delighted that you dropped in
As though they cared
Sit right down Have a cigarette or a cigar  He walkedaround the room quickly ringing bells  I ll have somethingto drink for you in just a minute
He was profoundly afected by the fact that Tom wasthere But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had giventhem something realizing in a vague way that that was allthey came for Mr Sloane wanted nothing A lemonadeNo thanks A little champagne Nothing at all thanks I m sorry
Did you have a nice ride
Very good roads around here
I suppose the automobiles
Yeah
Moved by an irresistible impulse Gatsby turned to Tomwho had accepted the introduction as a stranger I believe we ve met somewhere before Mr Buchanan  Oh yes  said Tom grufy polite but obviously not re-membering  So we did I remember very well
About two weeks ago
Tat s right You were with Nick here
I know your wife  continued Gatsby almost aggressive-ly
Tat so
Tom turned to me
You live near here Nick
Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    10   Next door
Tat so
Mr Sloane didn t enter into the conversation but loungedback haughtily in his chair the woman said nothing ei-ther until unexpectedly afer two highballs she becamecordial
We ll all come over to your next party Mr Gatsby  shesuggested  What do you say
Certainly I d be delighted to have you
Be ver  nice  said Mr Sloane without gratitude  Well think ought to be starting home
Please don t hurry  Gatsby urged them He had controlof himself now and he wanted to see more of Tom  Whydon t you why don t you stay for supper I wouldn t be sur-prised if some other people dropped in from New York  You come to supper with ME  said the lady enthusiasti-cally  Both of you
Tis included me Mr Sloane got to his feet
Come along  he said but to her only
I mean it  she insisted  I d love to have you Lots ofroom
Gatsby looked at me questioningly He wanted to go andhe didn t see that Mr Sloane had determined he shouldn t I m afraid I won t be able to  I said
Well you come  she urged concentrating on GatsbyMr Sloane murmured something close to her ear We won t be late if we start now  she insisted aloud I haven t got a horse  said Gatsby  I used to ride in thearmy but I ve never bought a horse I ll have to follow you in110    The Great Gatsbymy car Excuse me for just a minute
Te rest of us walked out on the porch where Sloane andthe lady began an impassioned conversation aside My God I believe the man s coming  said Tom  Doesn the know she doesn t want him
She says she does want him
She has a big dinner party and he won t know a soulthere  He frowned  I wonder where in the devil he met Dai-sy By God I may be old-fashioned in my ideas but womenrun around too much these days to suit me Tey meet allkinds of crazy fsh
Suddenly Mr Sloane and the lady walked down the stepsand mounted their horses
Come on  said Mr Sloane to Tom  we re late We vegot to go  And then to me  Tell him we couldn t wait willyou
Tom and I shook hands the rest of us exchanged a coolnod and they trotted quickly down the drive disappearingunder the August foliage just as Gatsby with hat and lightovercoat in hand came out the front door
Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy s running aroundalone for on the following Saturday night he came with herto Gatsby s party Perhaps his presence gave the eveningits peculiar quality of oppressiveness it stands out in mymemory from Gatsby s other parties that summer Terewere the same people or at least the same sort of peoplethe same profusion of champagne the same many-coloredmany-keyed commotion but I felt an unpleasantness in theair a pervading harshness that hadn t been there beforeFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    111Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it grown to acceptWest Egg as a world complete in itself with its own stan-dards and its own great fgures second to nothing becauseit had no consciousness of being so and now I was lookingat it again through Daisy s eyes It is invariably saddeningto look through new eyes at things upon which you have ex-pended your own powers of adjustment
Tey arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among thesparkling hundreds Daisy s voice was playing murmuroustricks in her throat
Tese things excite me SO  she whispered  If you wantto kiss me any time during the evening Nick just let meknow and I ll be glad to arrange it for you Just mention myname Or present a green card I m giving out green    Look around  suggested Gatsby
I m looking around I m having a marvelous    You must see the faces of many people you ve heardabout
Tom s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd
We don t go around very much  he said  In fact I wasjust thinking I don t know a soul here
Perhaps you know that lady  Gatsby indicated a gor-geous scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in stateunder a white plum tree Tom and Daisy stared with thatpeculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognitionof a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies
She s lovely  said Daisy
Te man bending over her is her director
He took them ceremoniously from group to group11    The Great Gatsby   Mrs Buchanan   and Mr Buchanan    Afer an in-stant s hesitation he added  the polo player
Oh no  objected Tom quickly  Not me
But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom re-mained  the polo player  for the rest of the evening I ve never met so many celebrities  Daisy exclaimed  Iliked that man what was his name with the sort of bluenose
Gatsby identifed him adding that he was a small pro-ducer
Well I liked him anyhow
I d a little rather not be the polo player  said Tom pleas-antly  I d rather look at all these famous people in inoblivion
Daisy and Gatsby danced I remember being surprisedby his graceful conservative fox-trot I had never seen himdance before Ten they sauntered over to my house and saton the steps for half an hour while at her request I remainedwatchfully in the garden  In case there s a fre or a food she explained  or any act of God
Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting downto supper together  Do you mind if I eat with some peopleover here  he said  A fellow s getting of some funny stuf  Go ahead  answered Daisy genially  And if you wantto take down any addresses here s my little gold pencil  She looked around afer a moment and told me the girl was common but pretty  and I knew that except for the halfhour she d been alone with Gatsby she wasn t having a goodtime
Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    11  We were at a particularly tipsy table Tat was my fault Gatsby had been called to the phone and I d enjoyed thesesame people only two weeks before But what had amusedme then turned septic on the air now
How do you feel Miss Baedeker
Te girl addressed was trying unsuccessfully to slumpagainst my shoulder At this inquiry she sat up and openedher eyes
Wha
A massive and lethargic woman who had been urgingDaisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow spokein Miss Baedeker s defence
Oh she s all right now When she s had fve or six cock-tails she always starts screaming like that I tell her sheought to leave it alone
I do leave it alone  afrmed the accused hollowly We heard you yelling so I said to Doc Civet here  Tere ssomebody that needs your help Doc
She s much obliged I m sure  said another friend with-out gratitude  But you got her dress all wet when you stuckher head in the pool
Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool  mum-bled Miss Baedeker  Tey almost drowned me once over inNew Jersey
Ten you ought to leave it alone  countered Doctor Civ-et
Speak for yourself  cried Miss Baedeker violently  Yourhand shakes I wouldn t let you operate on me It was like that Almost the last thing I remember was11    The Great Gatsbystanding with Daisy and watching the moving picture di-rector and his Star Tey were still under the white plumtree and their faces were touching except for a pale thin rayof moonlight between It occurred to me that he had beenvery slowly bending toward her all evening to attain thisproximity and even while I watched I saw him stoop oneultimate degree and kiss at her cheek
I like her  said Daisy  I think she s lovely
But the rest ofended her and inarguably because itwasn t a gesture but an emotion She was appalled by WestEgg this unprecedented  place  that Broadway had begot-ten upon a Long Island fshing village appalled by its rawvigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the tooobtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short cutfrom nothing to nothing She saw something awful in thevery simplicity she failed to understand
I sat on the front steps with them while they waited fortheir car It was dark here in front only the bright doorsent ten square feet of light volleying out into the sof blackmorning Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing-room blind above gave way to another shadow an indefniteprocession of shadows who rouged and powdered in an in-visible glass
Who is this Gatsby anyhow  demanded Tom suddenly Some big bootlegger
Where d you hear that  I inquired
I didn t hear it I imagined it A lot of these newly richpeople are just big bootleggers you know
Not Gatsby  I said shortly
Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    11  He was silent for a moment Te pebbles of the drivecrunched under his feet
Well he certainly must have strained himself to get thismenagerie together
A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy s fur collar At least they re more interesting than the people weknow  she said with an efort
You didn t look so interested
Well I was
Tom laughed and turned to me
Did you notice Daisy s face when that girl asked her toput her under a cold shower
Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky rhyth-mic whisper bringing out a meaning in each word that ithad never had before and would never have again Whenthe melody rose her voice broke up sweetly following it ina way contralto voices have and each change tipped out alittle of her warm human magic upon the air
Lots of people come who haven t been invited  she saidsuddenly  Tat girl hadn t been invited Tey simply forcetheir way in and he s too polite to object
I d like to know who he is and what he does  insistedTom  And I think I ll make a point of fnding out  I can tell you right now  she answered  He owned somedrug stores a lot of drug stores He built them up himself Te dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive Good night Nick  said Daisy
Her glance lef me and sought the lighted top of the stepswhere  Tree o Clock in the Morning  a neat sad little waltz11    The Great Gatsbyof that year was drifing out the open door Afer all in thevery casualness of Gatsby s party there were romantic pos-sibilities totally absent from her world What was it up therein the song that seemed to be calling her back inside Whatwould happen now in the dim incalculable hours Perhapssome unbelievable guest would arrive a person infnite-ly rare and to be marvelled at some authentically radiantyoung girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby one mo-ment of magical encounter would blot out those fve yearsof unwavering devotion
I stayed late that night Gatsby asked me to wait until hewas free and I lingered in the garden until the inevitableswimming party had run up chilled and exalted from theblack beach until the lights were extinguished in the guestrooms overhead When he came down the steps at last thetanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face and hiseyes were bright and tired
She didn t like it  he said immediately
Of course she did
She didn t like it  he insisted  She didn t have a goodtime
He was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depres-sion
I feel far away from her  he said  It s hard to make herunderstand
You mean about the dance
Te dance  He dismissed all the dances he had givenwith a snap of his fngers  Old sport the dance is unim-portant
Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    11  He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should goto Tom and say  I never loved you  Afer she had obliter-ated three years with that sentence they could decide uponthe more practical measures to be taken One of them wasthat afer she was free they were to go back to Louisvilleand be married from her house just as if it were fve yearsago
And she doesn t understand  he said  She used to beable to understand We d sit for hours
He broke of and began to walk up and down a desolatepath of fruit rinds and discarded favors and crushed fow-ers
I wouldn t ask too much of her  I ventured  You can trepeat the past
Can t repeat the past  he cried incredulously  Why ofcourse you can
He looked around him wildly as if the past were lurk-ing here in the shadow of his house just out of reach of hishand
I m going to fx everything just the way it was before  hesaid nodding determinedly  She ll see
He talked a lot about the past and I gathered that hewanted to recover something some idea of himself perhapsthat had gone into loving Daisy His life had been confusedand disordered since then but if he could once return to acertain starting place and go over it all slowly he could fndout what that thing was 
  One autumn night fve years before they had beenwalking down the street when the leaves were falling and11    The Great Gatsbythey came to a place where there were no trees and the side-walk was white with moonlight Tey stopped here andturned toward each other Now it was a cool night with thatmysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changesof the year Te quiet lights in the houses were hummingout into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle amongthe stars Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that theblocks of the sidewalk really formed a ladder and mountedto a secret place above the trees he could climb to it if heclimbed alone and once there he could suck on the pap oflife gulp down the incomparable milk of wonderHis heart beat faster and faster as Daisy s white face cameup to his own He knew that when he kissed this girl andforever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breathhis mind would never romp again like the mind of God Sohe waited listening for a moment longer to the tuning forkthat had been struck upon a star Ten he kissed her At hislips  touch she blossomed for him like a fower and the in-carnation was complete
Trough all he said even through his appalling sen-timentality I was reminded of something an elusiverhythm a fragment of lost words that I had heard some-where a long time ago For a moment a phrase tried to takeshape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man s asthough there was more struggling upon them than a wisp ofstartled air But they made no sound and what I had almostremembered was uncommunicable forever

Only gradually did I become aware that the automobileswhich turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just aminute and then drove sulkily away Wondering if he weresick I went over to fnd out an unfamiliar butler with a vil-lainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door Is Mr Gatsby sick
Nope  Afer a pause he added  sir  in a dilatory grudg-ing way
I hadn t seen him around and I was rather worried Tellhim Mr Carraway came over
Who  he demanded rudely
Carraway
Carraway All right I ll tell him  Abruptly he slammedthe door
My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed everyservant in his house a week ago and replaced them withhalf a dozen others who never went into West Egg Villageto be bribed by the tradesmen but ordered moderate sup-plies over the telephone Te grocery boy reported that thekitchen looked like a pigsty and the general opinion in the10    The Great Gatsbyvillage was that the new people weren t servants at allNext day Gatsby called me on the phone
Going away  I inquired
No old sport
I hear you fred all your servants
I wanted somebody who wouldn t gossip Daisy comesover quite ofen in the afernoons
So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card houseat the disapproval in her eyes
Tey re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do some-thing for Tey re all brothers and sisters Tey used to runa small hotel
I see
He was calling up at Daisy s request would I come tolunch at her house tomorrow Miss Baker would be thereHalf an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed re-lieved to fnd that I was coming Something was up Andyet I couldn t believe that they would choose this occasionfor a scene especially for the rather harrowing scene thatGatsby had outlined in the garden
Te next day was broiling almost the last certainly thewarmest of the summer As my train emerged from thetunnel into sunlight only the hot whistles of the NationalBiscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon Testraw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustionthe woman next to me perspired delicately for a while intoher white shirtwaist and then as her newspaper dampenedunder her fngers lapsed despairingly into deep heat with adesolate cry Her pocket-book slapped to the foorFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    11   Oh my  she gasped
I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back toher holding it at arm s length and by the extreme tip of thecorners to indicate that I had no designs upon it but ev-ery one near by including the woman suspected me justthe same
Hot  said the conductor to familiar faces  Some weath-er Hot Hot Hot Is it hot enough for you Is it hot Is it  
My commutation ticket came back to me with a darkstain from his hand Tat any one should care in this heatwhose fushed lips he kissed whose head made damp thepajama pocket over his heart
  Trough the hall of the Buchanans  house blew a faintwind carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsbyand me as we waited at the door
Te master s body  roared the butler into the mouth-piece  I m sorry madame but we can t furnish it it s fartoo hot to touch this noon
What he really said was  Yes   yes   I ll see He set down the receiver and came toward us glisteningslightly to take our stif straw hats
Madame expects you in the salon  he cried needless-ly indicating the direction In this heat every extra gesturewas an afront to the common store of life
Te room shadowed well with awnings was dark andcool Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch likesilver idols weighing down their own white dresses againstthe singing breeze of the fans
1    The Great Gatsby   We can t move  they said together
Jordan s fngers powdered white over their tan restedfor a moment in mine
And Mr Tomas Buchanan the athlete  I inquiredSimultaneously I heard his voice gruf mufed huskyat the hall telephone
Gatsby stood in the center of the crimson carpet andgazed around with fascinated eyes Daisy watched him andlaughed her sweet exciting laugh a tiny gust of powderrose from her bosom into the air
Te rumor is  whispered Jordan  that that s Tom s girlon the telephone
We were silent Te voice in the hall rose high with an-noyance  Very well then I won t sell you the car at all I m under no obligations to you at all  And as for yourbothering me about it at lunch time I won t stand that atall
Holding down the receiver  said Daisy cynically No he s not  I assured her  It s a bona fde deal I happento know about it
Tom fung open the door blocked out its space for a mo-ment with his thick body and hurried into the room Mr Gatsby  He put out his broad fat hand with well-concealed dislike  I m glad to see you sir  Nick   Make us a cold drink  cried Daisy
As he lef the room again she got up and went overto Gatsby and pulled his face down kissing him on themouth
You know I love you  she murmured
Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1   You forget there s a lady present  said JordanDaisy looked around doubtfully
You kiss Nick too
What a low vulgar girl
I don t care  cried Daisy and began to clog on the brickfreplace Ten she remembered the heat and sat down guilt-ily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading alittle girl came into the room
Bles-sed pre-cious  she crooned holding out her arms Come to your own mother that loves you
Te child relinquished by the nurse rushed across theroom and rooted shyly into her mother s dress
Te Bles-sed pre-cious Did mother get powder on yourold yellowy hair Stand up now and say How-de-do Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small re-luctant hand Aferward he kept looking at the child withsurprise I don t think he had ever really believed in its ex-istence before
I got dressed before luncheon  said the child turningeagerly to Daisy
Tat s because your mother wanted to show you of  Herface bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck You dream you You absolute little dream
Yes  admitted the child calmly  Aunt Jordan s got on awhite dress too
How do you like mother s friends  Daisy turned heraround so that she faced Gatsby  Do you think they re pret-ty
Where s Daddy
1    The Great Gatsby   She doesn t look like her father  explained Daisy  Shelooks like me She s got my hair and shape of the face Daisy sat back upon the couch Te nurse took a step for-ward and held out her hand
Come Pammy
Goodbye sweetheart
With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplinedchild held to her nurse s hand and was pulled out the doorjust as Tom came back preceding four gin rickeys thatclicked full of ice
Gatsby took up his drink
Tey certainly look cool  he said with visible tensionWe drank in long greedy swallows
I read somewhere that the sun s getting hotter ev-ery year  said Tom genially  It seems that pretty soon theearth s going to fall into the sun or wait a minute it s justthe opposite the sun s getting colder every year Come outside  he suggested to Gatsby  I d like you tohave a look at the place
I went with them out to the veranda On the green Soundstagnant in the heat one small sail crawled slowly towardthe fresher sea Gatsby s eyes followed it momentarily heraised his hand and pointed across the bay
I m right across from you
So you are
Our eyes lifed over the rosebeds and the hot lawn andthe weedy refuse of the dog days along shore Slowly thewhite wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit ofthe sky Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the aboundingFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1blessed isles
Tere s sport for you  said Tom nodding  I d like to beout there with him for about an hour
We had luncheon in the dining-room darkened tooagainst the heat and drank down nervous gayety with thecold ale
What ll we do with ourselves this afernoon  cried Dai-sy  and the day afer that and the next thirty years  Don t be morbid  Jordan said  Life starts all over againwhen it gets crisp in the fall
But it s so hot  insisted Daisy on the verge of tears  Andeverything s so confused Let s all go to town
Her voice struggled on through the heat beating againstit moulding its senselessness into forms
I ve heard of making a garage out of a stable  Tom wassaying to Gatsby  but I m the frst man who ever made astable out of a garage
Who wants to go to town  demanded Daisy insistentlyGatsby s eyes foated toward her  Ah  she cried  you lookso cool
Teir eyes met and they stared together at each otheralone in space With an efort she glanced down at the ta-ble
You always look so cool  she repeated
She had told him that she loved him and Tom Buchanansaw He was astounded His mouth opened a little and helooked at Gatsby and then back at Daisy as if he had just rec-ognized her as some one he knew a long time ago You resemble the advertisement of the man  she went on1    The Great Gatsbyinnocently  You know the advertisement of the man    All right  broke in Tom quickly  I m perfectly willing togo to town Come on we re all going to town He got up his eyes still fashing between Gatsby and hiswife No one moved
Come on  His temper cracked a little  What s the mat-ter anyhow If we re going to town let s start
His hand trembling with his efort at self control boreto his lips the last of his glass of ale Daisy s voice got us toour feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive
Are we just going to go  she objected  Like this Aren twe going to let any one smoke a cigarette frst  Everybody smoked all through lunch
Oh let s have fun  she begged him  It s too hot to fuss He didn t answer
Have it your own way  she said  Come on Jordan Tey went upstairs to get ready while we three men stoodthere shufing the hot pebbles with our feet A silver curveof the moon hovered already in the western sky Gatsbystarted to speak changed his mind but not before Tomwheeled and faced him expectantly
Have you got your stables here  asked Gatsby with anefort
About a quarter of a mile down the road
Oh
A pause
I don t see the idea of going to town  broke out Tom sav-agely  Women get these notions in their heads    Shall we take anything to drink  called Daisy from anFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1upper window
I ll get some whiskey  answered Tom He went insideGatsby turned to me rigidly
I can t say anything in his house old sport  She s got an indiscreet voice  I remarked  It s full of
I hesitated
Her voice is full of money  he said suddenlyTat was it I d never understood before It was full ofmoney that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fellin it the jingle of it the cymbals  song of it  High in awhite palace the king s daughter the golden girl Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle ina towel followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tighthats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over theirarms
Shall we all go in my car  suggested Gatsby He felt thehot green leather of the seat  I ought to have lef it in theshade
Is it standard shif  demanded Tom
Yes
Well you take my coup and let me drive your car totown
Te suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby
I don t think there s much gas  he objected
Plenty of gas  said Tom boisterously He looked at thegauge  And if it runs out I can stop at a drug store You canbuy anything at a drug store nowadays
A pause followed this apparently pointless remark Dai-1    The Great Gatsbysy looked at Tom frowning and an indefnable expressionat once defnitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable as ifI had only heard it described in words passed over Gatsby sface
Come on Daisy  said Tom pressing her with his handtoward Gatsby s car  I ll take you in this circus wagon He opened the door but she moved out from the circleof his arm
You take Nick and Jordan We ll follow you in the cou-p
She walked close to Gatsby touching his coat with herhand Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gats-by s car Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively andwe shot of into the oppressive heat leaving them out of sightbehind
Did you see that  demanded Tom
See what
He looked at me keenly realizing that Jordan and I musthave known all along
You think I m pretty dumb don t you  he suggested Perhaps I am but I have a almost a second sight some-times that tells me what to do Maybe you don t believethat but science
He paused Te immediate contingency overtook himpulled him back from the edge of the theoretical abyss I ve made a small investigation of this fellow  he contin-ued  I could have gone deeper if I d known    Do you mean you ve been to a medium  inquired Jor-dan humorously
Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1   What  Confused he stared at us as we laughed  A me-dium
About Gatsby
About Gatsby No I haven t I said I d been making asmall investigation of his past
And you found he was an Oxford man  said Jordanhelpfully
An Oxford man  He was incredulous  Like hell he isHe wears a pink suit
Nevertheless he s an Oxford man
Oxford New Mexico  snorted Tom contemptuously  orsomething like that
Listen Tom If you re such a snob why did you invitehim to lunch  demanded Jordan crossly
Daisy invited him she knew him before we were mar-ried God knows where
We were all irritable now with the fading ale and awareof it we drove for a while in silence Ten as Doctor T JEckleburg s faded eyes came into sight down the road I re-membered Gatsby s caution about gasoline
We ve got enough to get us to town  said Tom But there s a garage right here  objected Jordan  I don twant to get stalled in this baking heat
Tom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to anabrupt dusty stop under Wilson s sign Afer a moment theproprietor emerged from the interior of his establishmentand gazed hollow-eyed at the car
Let s have some gas  cried Tom roughly  What do youthink we stopped for to admire the view
10    The Great Gatsby   I m sick  said Wilson without moving  I been sick allday
What s the matter
I m all run down
Well shall I help myself  Tom demanded  You sound-ed well enough on the phone
With an efort Wilson lef the shade and support of thedoorway and breathing hard unscrewed the cap of thetank In the sunlight his face was green
I didn t mean to interrupt your lunch  he said  But Ineed money pretty bad and I was wondering what you weregoing to do with your old car
How do you like this one  inquired Tom  I bought itlast week
It s a nice yellow one  said Wilson as he strained at thehandle
Like to buy it
Big chance  Wilson smiled faintly  No but I could makesome money on the other
What do you want money for all of a sudden  I ve been here too long I want to get away My wife andI want to go west
Your wife does  exclaimed Tom startled
She s been talking about it for ten years  He rested fora moment against the pump shading his eyes  And nowshe s going whether she wants to or not I m going to gether away

What do I owe you
Dollar twenty
Te relentless beating heat was beginning to confuseme and I had a bad moment there before I realized that sofar his suspicions hadn t alighted on Tom He had discov-ered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him inanother world and the shock had made him physically sickI stared at him and then at Tom who had made a paralleldiscovery less than an hour before and it occurred to methat there was no diference between men in intelligence orrace so profound as the diference between the sick and thewell Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty unforgivablyguilty as if he had just got some poor girl with child I ll let you have that car  said Tom  I ll send it over to-morrow afernoon
Tat locality was always vaguely disquieting even inthe broad glare of afernoon and now I turned my head asthough I had been warned of something behind Over theashheaps the giant eyes of Doctor T J Eckleburg kept theirvigil but I perceived afer a moment that other eyes wereregarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twentyfeet away
In one of the windows over the garage the curtains hadbeen moved aside a little and Myrtle Wilson was peeringdown at the car So engrossed was she that she had no con-1    The Great Gatsbysciousness of being observed and one emotion afer anothercrept into her face like objects into a slowly developing pic-ture Her expression was curiously familiar it was anexpression I had ofen seen on women s faces but on MyrtleWilson s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable untilI realized that her eyes wide with jealous terror were fxednot on Tom but on Jordan Baker whom she took to be hiswife
Tere is no confusion like the confusion of a simplemind and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whipsof panic His wife and his mistress until an hour ago secureand inviolate were slipping precipitately from his controlInstinct made him step on the accelerator with the doublepurpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behindand we sped along toward Astoria at ffy miles an houruntil among the spidery girders of the elevated we came insight of the easygoing blue coup
Tose big movies around Fifieth Street are cool  sug-gested Jordan  I love New York on summer afernoonswhen every one s away Tere s something very sensuousabout it overripe as if all sorts of funny fruits were goingto fall into your hands
Te word  sensuous  had the efect of further disquietingTom but before he could invent a protest the coup came toa stop and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside Where are we going  she cried
How about the movies
It s so hot  she complained  You go We ll ride aroundand meet you afer  With an efort her wit rose faintlyFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1 We ll meet you on some corner I ll be the man smokingtwo cigarettes
We can t argue about it here  Tom said impatiently as atruck gave out a cursing whistle behind us  You follow meto the south side of Central Park in front of the Plaza Several times he turned his head and looked back fortheir car and if the trafc delayed them he slowed up untilthey came into sight I think he was afraid they would dartdown a side street and out of his life forever
But they didn t And we all took the less explicable stepof engaging the parlor of a suite in the Plaza HotelTe prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended byherding us into that room eludes me though I have a sharpphysical memory that in the course of it my underwearkept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and in-termittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back Tenotion originated with Daisy s suggestion that we hire fvebathrooms and take cold baths and then assumed moretangible form as  a place to have a mint julep  Each of ussaid over and over that it was a  crazy idea  we all talked atonce to a bafed clerk and thought or pretended to thinkthat we were being very funny 
Te room was large and stifing and though it was al-ready four o clock opening the windows admitted only agust of hot shrubbery from the Park Daisy went to the mir-ror and stood with her back to us fxing her hair It s a swell suite  whispered Jordan respectfully and ev-ery one laughed
Open another window  commanded Daisy without1    The Great Gatsbyturning around
Tere aren t any more
Well we d better telephone for an axe
Te thing to do is to forget about the heat  said Tom im-patiently  You make it ten times worse by crabbing aboutit
He unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and putit on the table
Why not let her alone old sport  remarked Gatsby You re the one that wanted to come to town
Tere was a moment of silence Te telephone bookslipped from its nail and splashed to the foor whereup-on Jordan whispered  Excuse me  but this time no onelaughed
I ll pick it up  I ofered
I ve got it  Gatsby examined the parted string mut-tered  Hum  in an interested way and tossed the book ona chair
Tat s a great expression of yours isn t it  said Tomsharply
What is
All this  old sport  business Where d you pick that up  Now see here Tom  said Daisy turning around fromthe mirror  if you re going to make personal remarks Iwon t stay here a minute Call up and order some ice for themint julep
As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat ex-ploded into sound and we were listening to the portentouschords of Mendelssohn s Wedding March from the ball-Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1room below
Imagine marrying anybody in this heat  cried Jordandismally
Still I was married in the middle of June  Daisy re-membered  Louisville in June Somebody fainted Whowas it fainted Tom
Biloxi  he answered shortly
A man named Biloxi  Blocks  Biloxi and he made box-es that s a fact and he was from Biloxi Tennessee  Tey carried him into my house  appended Jordan because we lived just two doors from the church And hestayed three weeks until Daddy told him he had to get outTe day afer he lef Daddy died  Afer a moment she addedas if she might have sounded irreverent  Tere wasn t anyconnection
I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis  I re-marked
Tat was his cousin I knew his whole family historybefore he lef He gave me an aluminum putter that I usetoday
Te music had died down as the ceremony began andnow a long cheer foated in at the window followed by in-termittent cries of  Yea ea ea  and fnally by a burst ofjazz as the dancing began
We re getting old  said Daisy  If we were young we drise and dance
Remember Biloxi  Jordan warned her  Where d youknow him Tom
Biloxi  He concentrated with an efort  I didn t know1    The Great Gatsbyhim He was a friend of Daisy s
He was not  she denied  I d never seen him before Hecame down in the private car
Well he said he knew you He said he was raised in Lou-isville Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute andasked if we had room for him
Jordan smiled
He was probably bumming his way home He told me hewas president of your class at Yale
Tom and I looked at each other blankly
BilOxi
First place we didn t have any president   Gatsby s foot beat a short restless tattoo and Tom eyedhim suddenly
By the way Mr Gatsby I understand you re an Oxfordman
Not exactly
Oh yes I understand you went to Oxford
Yes I went there
A pause Ten Tom s voice incredulous and insulting You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went toNew Haven
Another pause A waiter knocked and came in withcrushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his Tank you  and the sof closing of the door Tis tremen-dous detail was to be cleared up at last
I told you I went there  said Gatsby
I heard you but I d like to know when
It was in nineteen-nineteen I only stayed fve monthsFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1Tat s why I can t really call myself an Oxford man Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbeliefBut we were all looking at Gatsby
It was an opportunity they gave to some of the ofcersafer the Armistice  he continued  We could go to any ofthe universities in England or France
I wanted to get up and slap him on the back I had oneof those renewals of complete faith in him that I d experi-enced before
Daisy rose smiling faintly and went to the table Open the whiskey Tom  she ordered  And I ll make youa mint julep Ten you won t seem so stupid to yourself Look at the mint
Wait a minute  snapped Tom  I want to ask Mr Gatsbyone more question
Go on  Gatsby said politely
What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my houseanyhow
Tey were out in the open at last and Gatsby was con-tent
He isn t causing a row  Daisy looked desperately fromone to the other  You re causing a row Please have a littleself control
Self control  repeated Tom incredulously  I suppose thelatest thing is to sit back and let Mr Nobody from Nowheremake love to your wife Well if that s the idea you can countme out  Nowadays people begin by sneering at familylife and family institutions and next they ll throw every-thing overboard and have intermarriage between black and1    The Great Gatsbywhite
Flushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himselfstanding alone on the last barrier of civilization We re all white here  murmured Jordan
I know I m not very popular I don t give big parties Isuppose you ve got to make your house into a pigsty in or-der to have any friends in the modern world Angry as I was as we all were I was tempted to laughwhenever he opened his mouth Te transition from liber-tine to prig was so complete
I ve got something to tell YOU old sport    beganGatsby But Daisy guessed at his intention
Please don t  she interrupted helplessly  Please let s allgo home Why don t we all go home
Tat s a good idea  I got up  Come on Tom Nobodywants a drink
I want to know what Mr Gatsby has to tell me  Your wife doesn t love you  said Gatsby  She s neverloved you She loves me
You must be crazy  exclaimed Tom automaticallyGatsby sprang to his feet vivid with excitement She never loved you do you hear  he cried  She onlymarried you because I was poor and she was tired of wait-ing for me It was a terrible mistake but in her heart shenever loved any one except me
At this point Jordan and I tried to go but Tom and Gats-by insisted with competitive frmness that we remain asthough neither of them had anything to conceal and itwould be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emo-Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1tions
Sit down Daisy  Tom s voice groped unsuccessfully forthe paternal note  What s been going on I want to hear allabout it
I told you what s been going on  said Gatsby  Going onfor fve years and you didn t know
Tom turned to Daisy sharply
You ve been seeing this fellow for fve years  Not seeing  said Gatsby  No we couldn t meet But bothof us loved each other all that time old sport and you didn tknow I used to laugh sometimes  but there was no laugh-ter in his eyes  to think that you didn t know
Oh that s all  Tom tapped his thick fngers togetherlike a clergyman and leaned back in his chair
You re crazy  he exploded  I can t speak about whathappened fve years ago because I didn t know Daisy then and I ll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of herunless you brought the groceries to the back door But allthe rest of that s a God Damned lie Daisy loved me whenshe married me and she loves me now
No  said Gatsby shaking his head
She does though Te trouble is that sometimes she getsfoolish ideas in her head and doesn t know what she s do-ing  He nodded sagely  And what s more I love Daisy tooOnce in a while I go of on a spree and make a fool of my-self but I always come back and in my heart I love her allthe time
You re revolting  said Daisy She turned to me and hervoice dropping an octave lower flled the room with thrill-10    The Great Gatsbying scorn  Do you know why we lef Chicago I m surprisedthat they didn t treat you to the story of that little spree Gatsby walked over and stood beside her
Daisy that s all over now  he said earnestly  It doesn tmatter any more Just tell him the truth that you neverloved him and it s all wiped out forever
She looked at him blindly  Why how could I lovehim possibly
You never loved him
She hesitated Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sortof appeal as though she realized at last what she was do-ing and as though she had never all along intended doinganything at all But it was done now It was too late I never loved him  she said with perceptible reluc-tance
Not at Kapiolani  demanded Tom suddenly No
From the ballroom beneath mufed and sufocatingchords were drifing up on hot waves of air
Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl tokeep your shoes dry  Tere was a husky tenderness in histone    Daisy
Please don t  Her voice was cold but the rancour wasgone from it She looked at Gatsby  Tere Jay  she said but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was tremblingSuddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match onthe carpet
Oh you want too much  she cried to Gatsby  I love younow isn t that enough I can t help what s past  She beganFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    11to sob helplessly  I did love him once but I loved you too Gatsby s eyes opened and closed
You loved me TOO  he repeated
Even that s a lie  said Tom savagely  She didn t knowyou were alive Why there re things between Daisy andme that you ll never know things that neither of us can everforget
Te words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby I want to speak to Daisy alone  he insisted  She s all ex-cited now
Even alone I can t say I never loved Tom  she admittedin a pitiful voice  It wouldn t be true
Of course it wouldn t  agreed Tom
She turned to her husband
As if it mattered to you  she said
Of course it matters I m going to take better care of youfrom now on
You don t understand  said Gatsby with a touch of pan-ic  You re not going to take care of her any more  I m not  Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed Hecould aford to control himself now  Why s that  Daisy s leaving you
Nonsense
I am though  she said with a visible efort
She s not leaving me  Tom s words suddenly leaneddown over Gatsby  Certainly not for a common swindlerwho d have to steal the ring he put on her fnger  I won t stand this  cried Daisy  Oh please let s get out  Who are you anyhow  broke out Tom  You re one of1    The Great Gatsbythat bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem thatmuch I happen to know I ve made a little investigation intoyour afairs and I ll carry it further tomorrow  You can suit yourself about that old sport  said Gatsbysteadily
I found out what your  drug stores  were  He turned tous and spoke rapidly  He and this Wolfshiem bought up alot of side-street drug stores here and in Chicago and soldgrain alcohol over the counter Tat s one of his little stuntsI picked him for a bootlegger the frst time I saw him and Iwasn t far wrong
What about it  said Gatsby politely  I guess your friendWalter Chase wasn t too proud to come in on it  And you lef him in the lurch didn t you You let him goto jail for a month over in New Jersey God You ought tohear Walter on the subject of YOU
He came to us dead broke He was very glad to pick upsome money old sport
Don t you call me  old sport   cried Tom Gatsby saidnothing  Walter could have you up on the betting laws toobut Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth Tat unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again inGatsby s face
Tat drug store business was just small change  con-tinued Tom slowly  but you ve got something on now thatWalter s afraid to tell me about
I glanced at Daisy who was staring terrifed betweenGatsby and her husband and at Jordan who had begun tobalance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of herFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1chin Ten I turned back to Gatsby and was startled athis expression He looked and this is said in all contemptfor the babbled slander of his garden as if he had  killed aman  For a moment the set of his face could be described injust that fantastic way
It passed and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy deny-ing everything defending his name against accusations thathad not been made But with every word she was drawingfurther and further into herself so he gave that up and onlythe dead dream fought on as the afernoon slipped awaytrying to touch what was no longer tangible struggling un-happily undespairingly toward that lost voice across theroom
Te voice begged again to go
PLEASE Tom I can t stand this any more
Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions what-ever courage she had had were defnitely gone You two start on home Daisy  said Tom  In Mr Gats-by s car
She looked at Tom alarmed now but he insisted withmagnanimous scorn
Go on He won t annoy you I think he realizes that hispresumptuous little firtation is over
Tey were gone without a word snapped out made ac-cidental isolated like ghosts even from our pityAfer a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the un-opened bottle of whiskey in the towel
Want any of this stuf Jordan   Nick
I didn t answer
1    The Great Gatsby   Nick  He asked again
What
Want any
No   I just remembered that today s my birthday I was thirty Before me stretched the portentous menac-ing road of a new decade
It was seven o clock when we got into the coup with himand started for Long Island Tom talked incessantly exult-ing and laughing but his voice was as remote from Jordanand me as the foreign clamor on the sidewalk or the tumultof the elevated overhead Human sympathy has its limitsand we were content to let all their tragic arguments fadewith the city lights behind Tirty the promise of a decadeof loneliness a thinning list of single men to know a thin-ning brief-case of enthusiasm thinning hair But there wasJordan beside me who unlike Daisy was too wise ever tocarry well-forgotten dreams from age to age As we passedover the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat sshoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away withthe reassuring pressure of her hand
So we drove on toward death through the cooling twi-light
Te young Greek Michaelis who ran the cofee joint be-side the ashheaps was the principal witness at the inquestHe had slept through the heat until afer fve when hestrolled over to the garage and found George Wilson sick inhis ofce really sick pale as his own pale hair and shakingall over Michaelis advised him to go to bed but Wilson re-fused saying that he d miss a lot of business if he did WhileFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racketbroke out overhead
I ve got my wife locked in up there  explained Wilsoncalmly  She s going to stay there till the day afer tomorrowand then we re going to move away
Michaelis was astonished they had been neighbors forfour years and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable ofsuch a statement Generally he was one of these worn-outmen when he wasn t working he sat on a chair in the door-way and stared at the people and the cars that passed alongthe road When any one spoke to him he invariably laughedin an agreeable colorless way He was his wife s man andnot his own
So naturally Michaelis tried to fnd out what had hap-pened but Wilson wouldn t say a word instead he beganto throw curious suspicious glances at his visitor and askhim what he d been doing at certain times on certain daysJust as the latter was getting uneasy some workmen camepast the door bound for his restaurant and Michaelis tookthe opportunity to get away intending to come back laterBut he didn t He supposed he forgot to that s all When hecame outside again a little afer seven he was reminded ofthe conversation because he heard Mrs Wilson s voice loudand scolding downstairs in the garage
Beat me  he heard her cry  Trow me down and beatme you dirty little coward
A moment later she rushed out into the dusk waving herhands and shouting before he could move from his doorthe business was over
1    The Great Gatsby  Te  death car  as the newspapers called it didn t stopit came out of the gathering darkness wavered tragicallyfor a moment and then disappeared around the next bendMichaelis wasn t even sure of its color he told the frst po-liceman that it was light green Te other car the one goingtoward New York came to rest a hundred yards beyondand its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson her lifeviolently extinguished knelt in the road and mingled herthick dark blood with the dust
Michaelis and this man reached her frst but when theyhad torn open her shirtwaist still damp with perspirationthey saw that her lef breast was swinging loose like a fapand there was no need to listen for the heart beneath Temouth was wide open and ripped at the corners as thoughshe had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitalityshe had stored so long
We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowdwhen we were still some distance away
Wreck  said Tom  Tat s good Wilson ll have a littlebusiness at last
He slowed down but still without any intention of stop-ping until as we came nearer the hushed intent faces of thepeople at the garage door made him automatically put onthe brakes
We ll take a look  he said doubtfully  just a look I became aware now of a hollow wailing sound which is-sued incessantly from the garage a sound which as we gotout of the coup and walked toward the door resolved it-self into the words  Oh my God  uttered over and over inFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1a gasping moan
Tere s some bad trouble here  said Tom excitedlyHe reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle ofheads into the garage which was lit only by a yellow lightin a swinging wire basket overhead Ten he made a harshsound in his throat and with a violent thrusting movementof his powerful arms pushed his way through
Te circle closed up again with a running murmur of ex-postulation it was a minute before I could see anything atall Ten new arrivals disarranged the line and Jordan and Iwere pushed suddenly inside
Myrtle Wilson s body wrapped in a blanket and thenin another blanket as though she sufered from a chill inthe hot night lay on a work table by the wall and Tomwith his back to us was bending over it motionless Nextto him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down nameswith much sweat and correction in a little book At frst Icouldn t fnd the source of the high groaning words thatechoed clamorously through the bare garage then I sawWilson standing on the raised threshold of his ofce sway-ing back and forth and holding to the doorposts with bothhands Some man was talking to him in a low voice andattempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoul-der but Wilson neither heard nor saw His eyes would dropslowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the walland then jerk back to the light again and he gave out inces-santly his high horrible call
O my Ga-od O my Ga-od Oh Ga-od Oh my Ga-od
1    The Great Gatsby  Presently Tom lifed his head with a jerk and afer staringaround the garage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbledincoherent remark to the policeman
M-a-v   the policeman was saying   o    No r   corrected the man  M-a-v-r-o    Listen to me  muttered Tom fercely

What happened that s what I want to know  Auto hit her Ins antly killed
Instantly killed  repeated Tom staring
She ran out ina road Son-of-a-bitch didn t even stopuscar
Tere was two cars  said Michaelis  one comin  onegoin  see
Going where  asked the policeman keenly
One goin  each way Well she   His hand rose towardthe blankets but stopped half way and fell to his side   sheran out there an  the one comin  from N York knock rightinto her goin  thirty or forty miles an hour
What s the name of this place here  demanded the of-fcer
Hasn t got any name
A pale well-dressed Negro stepped near
It was a yellow car  he said  big yellow car New  See the accident  asked the policeman
No but the car passed me down the road going faster nFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1forty Going ffy sixty
Come here and let s have your name Look out now Iwant to get his name
Some words of this conversation must have reached Wil-son swaying in the ofce door for suddenly a new themefound voice among his gasping cries
You don t have to tell me what kind of car it was I knowwhat kind of car it was
Watching Tom I saw the wad of muscle back of hisshoulder tighten under his coat He walked quickly over toWilson and standing in front of him seized him frmly bythe upper arms
You ve got to pull yourself together  he said with sooth-ing grufness
Wilson s eyes fell upon Tom he started up on his tiptoesand then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tomheld him upright
Listen  said Tom shaking him a little  I just got here aminute ago from New York I was bringing you that coupwe ve been talking about Tat yellow car I was driving thisafernoon wasn t mine do you hear I haven t seen it all af-ternoon
Only the Negro and I were near enough to hear what hesaid but the policeman caught something in the tone andlooked over with truculent eyes
What s all that  he demanded
I m a friend of his  Tom turned his head but kept hishands frm on Wilson s body  He says he knows the car thatdid it  It was a yellow car
10    The Great Gatsby  Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspi-ciously at Tom
And what color s your car
It s a blue car a coup
We ve come straight from New York  I saidSome one who had been driving a little behind us con-frmed this and the policeman turned away
Now if you ll let me have that name again correct   Picking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into theofce set him down in a chair and came back
If somebody ll come here and sit with him  he snappedauthoritatively He watched while the two men standingclosest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into theroom Ten Tom shut the door on them and came down thesingle step his eyes avoiding the table As he passed close tome he whispered  Let s get out
Self consciously with his authoritative arms breakingthe way we pushed through the still gathering crowd pass-ing a hurried doctor case in hand who had been sent for inwild hope half an hour ago
Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend thenhis foot came down hard and the coup raced along throughthe night In a little while I heard a low husky sob and sawthat the tears were overfowing down his face
Te God Damn coward  he whimpered  He didn t evenstop his car
Te Buchanans  house foated suddenly toward usthrough the dark rustling trees Tom stopped beside theporch and looked up at the second foor where two win-Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    11dows bloomed with light among the vines
Daisy s home  he said As we got out of the car he glancedat me and frowned slightly
I ought to have dropped you in West Egg Nick Tere snothing we can do tonight
A change had come over him and he spoke gravely andwith decision As we walked across the moonlight gravel tothe porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phras-es
I ll telephone for a taxi to take you home and whileyou re waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchenand have them get you some supper if you want any  Heopened the door  Come in
No thanks But I d be glad if you d order me the taxi I llwait outside
Jordan put her hand on my arm
Won t you come in Nick
No thanks
I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone ButJordan lingered for a moment more
It s only half past nine  she said
I d be damned if I d go in I d had enough of all of themfor one day and suddenly that included Jordan too She musthave seen something of this in my expression for she turnedabruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house Isat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands untilI heard the phone taken up inside and the butler s voice call-ing a taxi Ten I walked slowly down the drive away fromthe house intending to wait by the gate
1    The Great Gatsby  I hadn t gone twenty yards when I heard my name andGatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path Imust have felt pretty weird by that time because I couldthink of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit un-der the moon
What are you doing  I inquired
Just standing here old sport
Somehow that seemed a despicable occupation For all Iknew he was going to rob the house in a moment I wouldn thave been surprised to see sinister faces the faces of  Wolf-shiem s people  behind him in the dark shrubbery Did you see any trouble on the road  he asked afer aminute
Yes
He hesitated
Was she killed
Yes
I thought so I told Daisy I thought so It s better that theshock should all come at once She stood it pretty well He spoke as if Daisy s reaction was the only thing thatmattered
I got to West Egg by a side road  he went on  and lef thecar in my garage I don t think anybody saw us but of courseI can t be sure
I disliked him so much by this time that I didn t fnd itnecessary to tell him he was wrong
Who was the woman  he inquired
Her name was Wilson Her husband owns the garageHow the devil did it happen
Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1   Well I tried to swing the wheel    He broke of andsuddenly I guessed at the truth
Was Daisy driving
Yes  he said afer a moment  but of course I ll say I wasYou see when we lef New York she was very nervous andshe thought it would steady her to drive and this womanrushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming theother way It all happened in a minute but it seemed to methat she wanted to speak to us thought we were somebodyshe knew Well frst Daisy turned away from the wom-an toward the other car and then she lost her nerve andturned back Te second my hand reached the wheel I feltthe shock it must have killed her instantly
It ripped her open
Don t tell me old sport  He winced  Anyhow Daisystepped on it I tried to make her stop but she couldn t so Ipulled on the emergency brake Ten she fell over into mylap and I drove on
She ll be all right tomorrow  he said presently  I m justgoing to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about thatunpleasantness this afernoon She s locked herself into herroom and if he tries any brutality she s going to turn thelight out and on again
He won t touch her  I said  He s not thinking abouther
I don t trust him old sport
How long are you going to wait
All night if necessary Anyhow till they all go to bed A new point of view occurred to me Suppose Tom found1    The Great Gatsbyout that Daisy had been driving He might think he saw aconnection in it he might think anything I looked at thehouse there were two or three bright windows downstairsand the pink glow from Daisy s room on the second foor You wait here  I said  I ll see if there s any sign of a com-motion
I walked back along the border of the lawn traversed thegravel sofly and tiptoed up the veranda steps Te draw-ing-room curtains were open and I saw that the room wasempty Crossing the porch where we had dined that Junenight three months before I came to a small rectangle oflight which I guessed was the pantry window Te blind wasdrawn but I found a rif at the sill
Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at thekitchen table with a plate of cold fried chicken betweenthem and two bottles of ale He was talking intently acrossthe table at her and in his earnestness his hand had fallenupon and covered her own Once in a while she looked upat him and nodded in agreement
Tey weren t happy and neither of them had touched thechicken or the ale and yet they weren t unhappy eitherTere was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy aboutthe picture and anybody would have said that they wereconspiring together
As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling itsway along the dark road toward the house Gatsby was wait-ing where I had lef him in the drive
Is it all quiet up there  he asked anxiously
Yes it s all quiet  I hesitated  You d better come homeFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1and get some sleep
He shook his head
I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed Good nightold sport
He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned backeagerly to his scrutiny of the house as though my presencemarred the sacredness of the vigil So I walked away and lefhim standing there in the moonlight watching over noth-ing

Crossing his lawn I saw that his front door was still openand he was leaning against a table in the hall heavy withdejection or sleep
Nothing happened  he said wanly  I waited and aboutfour o clock she came to the window and stood there for aminute and then turned out the light
His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it didthat night when we hunted through the great rooms for cig-arettes We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilionsand felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric lightswitches once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon thekeys of a ghostly piano Tere was an inexplicable amountof dust everywhere and the rooms were musty as thoughthey hadn t been aired for many days I found the humidoron an unfamiliar table with two stale dry cigarettes insideTrowing open the French windows of the drawing-roomwe sat smoking out into the darkness

Go away NOW old sport
Go to Atlantic City for a week or up to Montreal He wouldn t consider it He couldn t possibly leave Daisyuntil he knew what she was going to do He was clutching atsome last hope and I couldn t bear to shake him freeIt was this night that he told me the strange story of hisyouth with Dan Cody told it to me because  Jay Gatsby had broken up like glass against Tom s hard malice and thelong secret extravaganza was played out I think that hewould have acknowledged anything now without reservebut he wanted to talk about Daisy
She was the frst  nice  girl he had ever known In vari-ous unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with suchpeople but always with indiscernible barbed wire betweenHe found her excitingly desirable He went to her house atfrst with other ofcers from Camp Taylor then alone Itamazed him he had never been in such a beautiful housebefore But what gave it an air of breathless intensity wasthat Daisy lived there it was as casual a thing to her as histent out at camp was to him Tere was a ripe mystery aboutit a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool thanother bedrooms of gay and radiant activities taking placethrough its corridors and of romances that were not mustyand laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathingand redolent of this year s shining motor cars and of danc-es whose fowers were scarcely withered It excited him toothat many men had already loved Daisy it increased her1    The Great Gatsbyvalue in his eyes He felt their presence all about the housepervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrantemotions
But he knew that he was in Daisy s house by a colossalaccident However glorious might be his future as Jay Gats-by he was at present a penniless young man without a pastand at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform mightslip from his shoulders So he made the most of his time Hetook what he could get ravenously and unscrupulously eventually he took Daisy one still October night took herbecause he had no real right to touch her handHe might have despised himself for he had certainlytaken her under false pretenses I don t mean that he hadtraded on his phantom millions but he had deliberatelygiven Daisy a sense of security he let her believe that he wasa person from much the same stratum as herself that hewas fully able to take care of her As a matter of fact he hadno such facilities he had no comfortable family standingbehind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonalgovernment to be blown anywhere about the worldBut he didn t despise himself and it didn t turn out as hehad imagined He had intended probably to take what hecould and go but now he found that he had committedhimself to the following of a grail He knew that Daisy wasextraordinary but he didn t realize just how extraordinarya  nice  girl could be She vanished into her rich house intoher rich full life leaving Gatsby nothing He felt marriedto her that was all
When they met again two days later it was Gatsby whoFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1was breathless who was somehow betrayed Her porch wasbright with the bought luxury of star-shine the wicker ofthe settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward himand he kissed her curious and lovely mouth She had caughta cold and it made her voice huskier and more charmingthan ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of theyouth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves ofthe freshness of many clothes and of Daisy gleaming likesilver safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor I can t describe to you how surprised I was to fnd outI loved her old sport I even hoped for a while that she dthrow me over but she didn t because she was in love withme too She thought I knew a lot because I knew diferentthings from her  Well there I was way of my ambitionsgetting deeper in love every minute and all of a sudden Ididn t care What was the use of doing great things if I couldhave a better time telling her what I was going to do On the last afernoon before he went abroad he sat withDaisy in his arms for a long silent time It was a cold fallday with fre in the room and her cheeks fushed Now andthen she moved and he changed his arm a little and oncehe kissed her dark shining hair Te afernoon had madethem tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep memoryfor the long parting the next day promised Tey had neverbeen closer in their month of love nor communicated moreprofoundly one with another than when she brushed silentlips against his coat s shoulder or when he touched the endof her fngers gently as though she were asleepHe did extraordinarily well in the war He was a captain10    The Great Gatsbybefore he went to the front and following the Argonne bat-tles he got his majority and the command of the divisionalmachine guns Afer the Armistice he tried frantically toget home but some complication or misunderstanding senthim to Oxford instead He was worried now there was aquality of nervous despair in Daisy s letters She didn t seewhy he couldn t come She was feeling the pressure of theworld outside and she wanted to see him and feel his pres-ence beside her and be reassured that she was doing theright thing afer all
For Daisy was young and her artifcial world was redolentof orchids and pleasant cheerful snobbery and orchestraswhich set the rhythm of the year summing up the sadnessand suggestiveness of life in new tunes All night the sax-ophones wailed the hopeless comment of the  Beale StreetBlues  while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippersshufed the shining dust At the grey tea hour there werealways rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweetfever while fresh faces drifed here and there like rose pet-als blown by the sad horns around the foor
Trough this twilight universe Daisy began to moveagain with the season suddenly she was again keeping halfa dozen dates a day with half a dozen men and drowsingasleep at dawn with the beads and chifon of an eveningdress tangled among dying orchids on the foor beside herbed And all the time something within her was crying fora decision She wanted her life shaped now immediately and the decision must be made by some force of love ofmoney of unquestionable practicality that was close atFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    11hand
Tat force took shape in the middle of spring with the ar-rival of Tom Buchanan Tere was a wholesome bulkinessabout his person and his position and Daisy was fatteredDoubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain reliefTe letter reached Gatsby while he was still at OxfordIt was dawn now on Long Island and we went about open-ing the rest of the windows downstairs flling the housewith grey turning gold turning light Te shadow of a treefell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to singamong the blue leaves Tere was a slow pleasant movementin the air scarcely a wind promising a cool lovely day I don t think she ever loved him  Gatsby turned aroundfrom a window and looked at me challengingly  You mustremember old sport she was very excited this afernoonHe told her those things in a way that frightened her thatmade it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper And theresult was she hardly knew what she was saying He sat down gloomily
Of course she might have loved him just for a minutewhen they were frst married and loved me more eventhen do you see
Suddenly he came out with a curious remark In any case  he said  it was just personal
What could you make of that except to suspect someintensity in his conception of the afair that couldn t bemeasured
He came back from France when Tom and Daisy werestill on their wedding trip and made a miserable but irre-1    The Great Gatsbysistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay Hestayed there a week walking the streets where their foot-steps had clicked together through the November night andrevisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driv-en in her white car Just as Daisy s house had always seemedto him more mysterious and gay than other houses so hisidea of the city itself even though she was gone from it waspervaded with a melancholy beauty
He lef feeling that if he had searched harder he mighthave found her that he was leaving her behind Te day-coach he was penniless now was hot He went out to theopen vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair and the sta-tion slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings movedby Ten out into the spring felds where a yellow trolleyraced them for a minute with people in it who might oncehave seen the pale magic of her face along the casual streetTe track curved and now it was going away from thesun which as it sank lower seemed to spread itself in bene-diction over the vanishing city where she had drawn herbreath He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatchonly a wisp of air to save a fragment of the spot that she hadmade lovely for him But it was all going by too fast now forhis blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of itthe freshest and the best forever
It was nine o clock when we fnished breakfast and wentout on the porch Te night had made a sharp diference inthe weather and there was an autumn favor in the air Tegardener the last one of Gatsby s former servants came tothe foot of the steps

Don t do it today  Gatsby answered He turned to meapologetically  You know old sport I ve never used thatpool all summer
I looked at my watch and stood up
Twelve minutes to my train
I didn t want to go to the city I wasn t worth a decentstroke of work but it was more than that I didn t want toleave Gatsby I missed that train and then another before Icould get myself away
I ll call you up  I said fnally
Do old sport
I ll call you about noon
We walked slowly down the steps
I suppose Daisy ll call too  He looked at me anxiously asif he hoped I d corroborate this
I suppose so
Well goodbye
We shook hands and I started away Just before I reachedthe hedge I remembered something and turned around Tey re a rotten crowd  I shouted across the lawn  You reworth the whole damn bunch put together
I ve always been glad I said that It was the only compli-ment I ever gave him because I disapproved of him frombeginning to end First he nodded politely and then his facebroke into that radiant and understanding smile as if we dbeen in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time His gor-1    The Great Gatsbygeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color againstthe white steps and I thought of the night when I frst cameto his ancestral home three months before Te lawn anddrive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessedat his corruption and he had stood on those steps conceal-ing his incorruptible dream as he waved them goodbyeI thanked him for his hospitality We were always thank-ing him for that I and the others
Goodbye  I called  I enjoyed breakfast Gatsby Up in the city I tried for a while to list the quotationson an interminable amount of stock then I fell asleep inmy swivel-chair Just before noon the phone woke me and Istarted up with sweat breaking out on my forehead It wasJordan Baker she ofen called me up at this hour becausethe uncertainty of her own movements between hotels andclubs and private houses made her hard to fnd in any oth-er way Usually her voice came over the wire as somethingfresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had comesailing in at the ofce window but this morning it seemedharsh and dry
I ve lef Daisy s house  she said  I m at Hempstead andI m going down to Southampton this afernoon Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy s house butthe act annoyed me and her next remark made me rigid You weren t so nice to me last night
How could it have mattered then
Silence for a moment Ten
However I want to see you
I want to see you too

No I don t think this afernoon
Very well
It s impossible this afernoon Various
We talked like that for a while and then abruptly weweren t talking any longer I don t know which of us hungup with a sharp click but I know I didn t care I couldn thave talked to her across a tea-table that day if I never talkedto her again in this world
I called Gatsby s house a few minutes later but the linewas busy I tried four times fnally an exasperated cen-tral told me the wire was being kept open for long distancefrom Detroit Taking out my time-table I drew a small circlearound the three-ffy train Ten I leaned back in my chairand tried to think It was just noon
When I passed the ashheaps on the train that morningI had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car I sup-pose there d be a curious crowd around there all day withlittle boys searching for dark spots in the dust and somegarrulous man telling over and over what had happeneduntil it became less and less real even to him and he couldtell it no longer and Myrtle Wilson s tragic achievement wasforgotten Now I want to go back a little and tell what hap-pened at the garage afer we lef there the night beforeTey had difculty in locating the sister Catherine Shemust have broken her rule against drinking that night forwhen she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable tounderstand that the ambulance had already gone to Flush-1    The Great Gatsbying When they convinced her of this she immediatelyfainted as if that was the intolerable part of the afair Some-one kind or curious took her in his car and drove her in thewake of her sister s body
Until long afer midnight a changing crowd lapped upagainst the front of the garage while George Wilson rockedhimself back and forth on the couch inside For a while thedoor of the ofce was open and everyone who came into thegarage glanced irresistibly through it Finally someone saidit was a shame and closed the door Michaelis and severalother men were with him frst four or fve men later twoor three men Still later Michaelis had to ask the last strang-er to wait there ffeen minutes longer while he went back tohis own place and made a pot of cofee Afer that he stayedthere alone with Wilson until dawn
About three o clock the quality of Wilson s incoherentmuttering changed he grew quieter and began to talkabout the yellow car He announced that he had a way offnding out whom the yellow car belonged to and then heblurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had comefrom the city with her face bruised and her nose swollenBut when he heard himself say this he finched andbegan to cry  Oh my God  again in his groaning voice Mi-chaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him
How long have you been married George Come onthere try and sit still a minute and answer my questionHow long have you been married
Twelve years
Ever had any children Come on George sit still IFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1asked you a question Did you ever have any children Te hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dulllight and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing alongthe road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadn tstopped a few hours before He didn t like to go into the ga-rage because the work bench was stained where the bodyhad been lying so he moved uncomfortably around the of-fce he knew every object in it before morning and fromtime to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep himmore quiet
Have you got a church you go to sometimes GeorgeMaybe even if you haven t been there for a long time May-be I could call up the church and get a priest to come overand he could talk to you see
Don t belong to any
You ought to have a church George for times like thisYou must have gone to church once Didn t you get mar-ried in a church Listen George listen to me Didn t you getmarried in a church
Tat was a long time ago
Te efort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking for a moment he was silent Ten the same half knowinghalf bewildered look came back into his faded eyes Look in the drawer there  he said pointing at the desk Which drawer
Tat drawer that one
Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand Terewas nothing in it but a small expensive dog leash made ofleather and braided silver It was apparently new1    The Great Gatsby   Tis  he inquired holding it up
Wilson stared and nodded
I found it yesterday afernoon She tried to tell me aboutit but I knew it was something funny
You mean your wife bought it
She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau Michaelis didn t see anything odd in that and he gaveWilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought thedog leash But conceivably Wilson had heard some of thesesame explanations before from Myrtle because he begansaying  Oh my God  again in a whisper his comforter lefseveral explanations in the air
Ten he killed her  said Wilson His mouth droppedopen suddenly
Who did
I have a way of fnding out
You re morbid George  said his friend  Tis has been astrain to you and you don t know what you re saying You dbetter try and sit quiet till morning
He murdered her
It was an accident George
Wilson shook his head His eyes narrowed and his mouthwidened slightly with the ghost of a superior  Hm  I know  he said defnitely  I m one of these trusting fel-las and I don t think any harm to NObody but when I get toknow a thing I know it It was the man in that car She ranout to speak to him and he wouldn t stop
Michaelis had seen this too but it hadn t occurred to himthat there was any special signifcance in it He believed thatFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1Mrs Wilson had been running away from her husbandrather than trying to stop any particular car
How could she of been like that
She s a deep one  said Wilson as if that answered thequestion  Ah-h-h
He began to rock again and Michaelis stood twisting theleash in his hand
Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone forGeorge
Tis was a forlorn hope he was almost sure that Wilsonhad no friend there was not enough of him for his wife Hewas glad a little later when he noticed a change in the rooma blue quickening by the window and realized that dawnwasn t far of About fve o clock it was blue enough outsideto snap of the light
Wilson s glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps wheresmall grey clouds took on fantastic shape and scurried hereand there in the faint dawn wind
I spoke to her  he muttered afer a long silence  I toldher she might fool me but she couldn t fool God I took herto the window   With an efort he got up and walked tothe rear window and leaned with his face pressed againstit   and I said  God knows what you ve been doing ev-erything you ve been doing You may fool me but you can tfool God
Standing behind him Michaelis saw with a shock that hewas looking at the eyes of Doctor T J Eckleburg which hadjust emerged pale and enormous from the dissolving night God sees everything  repeated Wilson
10    The Great Gatsby   Tat s an advertisement  Michaelis assured him Some-thing made him turn away from the window and look backinto the room But Wilson stood there a long time his faceclose to the window pane nodding into the twilightBy six o clock Michaelis was worn out and grateful forthe sound of a car stopping outside It was one of the watch-ers of the night before who had promised to come back sohe cooked breakfast for three which he and the other manate together Wilson was quieter now and Michaelis wenthome to sleep when he awoke four hours later and hurriedback to the garage Wilson was gone
His movements he was on foot all the time were af-terward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gad s Hillwhere he bought a sandwich that he didn t eat and a cupof cofee He must have been tired and walking slowly forhe didn t reach Gad s Hill until noon Tus far there wasno difculty in accounting for his time there were boyswho had seen a man  acting sort of crazy  and motorists atwhom he stared oddly from the side of the road Ten forthree hours he disappeared from view Te police on thestrength of what he said to Michaelis that he  had a way offnding out  supposed that he spent that time going fromgarage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a yellow car Onthe other hand no garage man who had seen him ever cameforward and perhaps he had an easier surer way of fnd-ing out what he wanted to know By half past two he wasin West Egg where he asked someone the way to Gatsby shouse So by that time he knew Gatsby s name
At two o clock Gatsby put on his bathing suit and lefFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    11word with the butler that if any one phoned word was to bebrought to him at the pool He stopped at the garage for apneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during thesummer and the chaufeur helped him pump it up Ten hegave instructions that the open car wasn t to be taken outunder any circumstances and this was strange becausethe front right fender needed repair
Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the poolOnce he stopped and shifed it a little and the chaufeurasked him if he needed help but he shook his head and in amoment disappeared among the yellowing treesNo telephone message arrived but the butler went with-out his sleep and waited for it until four o clock until longafer there was any one to give it to if it came I have an ideathat Gatsby himself didn t believe it would come and per-haps he no longer cared If that was true he must have feltthat he had lost the old warm world paid a high price forliving too long with a single dream He must have lookedup at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves andshivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is andhow raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass Anew world material without being real where poor ghostsbreathing dreams like air drifed fortuitously about   likethat ashen fantastic fgure gliding toward him through theamorphous trees
Te chaufeur he was one of Wolfshiem s protgs heard the shots aferward he could only say that he hadn tthought anything much about them I drove from the sta-tion directly to Gatsby s house and my rushing anxiously1    The Great Gatsbyup the front steps was the frst thing that alarmed any oneBut they knew then I frmly believe With scarcely a wordsaid four of us the chaufeur butler gardener and I hur-ried down to the pool
Tere was a faint barely perceptible movement of thewater as the fresh fow from one end urged its way towardthe drain at the other With little ripples that were hardlythe shadows of waves the laden mattress moved irregularlydown the pool A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugat-ed the surface was enough to disturb its accidental coursewith its accidental burden Te touch of a cluster of leavesrevolved it slowly tracing like the leg of compass a thin redcircle in the water
It was afer we started with Gatsby toward the house thatthe gardener saw Wilson s body a little way of in the grassand the holocaust was complete

Afiegr ttw ao yde tars  I reexmt emayb eor tlhe  rs est  oef thlaet sd ady alln od  tphatlice and photographers and newspaper men in and out ofGatsby s front door A rope stretched across the main gateand a policeman by it kept out the curious but little boyssoon discovered that they could enter through my yard andthere were always a few of them clustered open-mouthedabout the pool Someone with a positive manner perhapsa detective used the expression  mad man  as he bent overWilson s body that afernoon and the adventitious author-ity of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports nextmorning
Most of those reports were a nightmare grotesque cir-cumstantial eager and untrue When Michaelis s testimonyat the inquest brought to light Wilson s suspicions of his wifeI thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racypasquinade but Catherine who might have said anythingdidn t say a word She showed a surprising amount of char-acter about it too looked at the coroner with determinedeyes under that corrected brow of hers and swore that hersister had never seen Gatsby that her sister was completelyhappy with her husband that her sister had been into nomischief whatever She convinced herself of it and criedinto her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more1    The Great Gatsbythan she could endure So Wilson was reduced to a man deranged by grief  in order that the case might remain inits simplest form And it rested there
But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential Ifound myself on Gatsby s side and alone From the momentI telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg villageevery surmise about him and every practical question wasreferred to me At frst I was surprised and confused thenas he lay in his house and didn t move or breathe or speakhour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible be-cause no one else was interested interested I mean withthat intense personal interest to which every one has somevague right at the end
I called up Daisy half an hour afer we found him calledher instinctively and without hesitation But she and Tomhad gone away early that afernoon and taken baggage withthem
Lef no address
No
Say when they d be back
No
Any idea where they are How I could reach them  I don t know Can t say
I wanted to get somebody for him I wanted to go intothe room where he lay and reassure him  I ll get somebodyfor you Gatsby Don t worry Just trust me and I ll get some-body for you

Will you ring again
I ve rung them three times
It s very important
Sorry I m afraid no one s there
I went back to the drawing room and thought for an in-stant that they were chance visitors all these ofcial peoplewho suddenly flled it But as they drew back the sheet andlooked at Gatsby with unmoved eyes his protest continuedin my brain
Look here old sport you ve got to get somebody for meYou ve got to try hard I can t go through this alone Some one started to ask me questions but I broke awayand going upstairs looked hastily through the unlockedparts of his desk he d never told me defnitely that his par-ents were dead But there was nothing only the picture ofDan Cody a token of forgotten violence staring down fromthe wall
Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letterto Wolfshiem which asked for information and urged himto come out on the next train Tat request seemed super-fuous when I wrote it I was sure he d start when he saw thenewspapers just as I was sure there d be a wire from Daisybefore noon but neither a wire nor Mr Wolfshiem arrivedno one arrived except more police and photographers andnewspaper men When the butler brought back Wolfshiem sanswer I began to have a feeling of defance of scornful soli-darity between Gatsby and me against them all1    The Great Gatsby  Dear Mr Carraway Tis has been one of the most terribleshocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is trueat all Such a mad act as that man did should make us allthink I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some veryimportant business and cannot get mixed up in this thingnow If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in aletter by Edgar I hardly know where I am when I hear abouta thing like this and am completely knocked down and outYours     trulyMEYER WOLFSHIEM
and then hasty addenda beneath
Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family atall
When the phone rang that afernoon and Long Distancesaid Chicago was calling I thought this would be Daisy atlast But the connection came through as a man s voice verythin and far away
Tis is Slagle speaking
Yes  Te name was unfamiliar
Hell of a note isn t it Get my wire
Tere haven t been any wires
Young Parke s in trouble  he said rapidly  Tey pickedhim up when he handed the bonds over the counter Teygot a circular from New York giving  em the numbers justfve minutes before What d you know about that hey Younever can tell in these hick towns
Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1   Hello  I interrupted breathlessly  Look here this isn tMr Gatsby Mr Gatsby s dead
Tere was a long silence on the other end of the wirefollowed by an exclamation   then a quick squawk as theconnection was broken
I think it was on the third day that a telegram signedHenry C Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota It saidonly that the sender was leaving immediately and to post-pone the funeral until he came
It was Gatsby s father a solemn old man very helplessand dismayed bundled up in a long cheap ulster againstthe warm September day His eyes leaked continuously withexcitement and when I took the bag and umbrella from hishands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse greybeard that I had difculty in getting of his coat He wason the point of collapse so I took him into the music roomand made him sit down while I sent for something to eatBut he wouldn t eat and the glass of milk spilled from histrembling hand
I saw it in the Chicago newspaper  he said  It was all inthe Chicago newspaper I started right away
I didn t know how to reach you
His eyes seeing nothing moved ceaselessly about theroom
It was a mad man  he said  He must have been mad  Wouldn t you like some cofee  I urged him I don t want anything I m all right now Mr    Carraway
Well I m all right now Where have they got Jimmy 1    The Great Gatsby  I took him into the drawing-room where his son lay andlef him there Some little boys had come up on the stepsand were looking into the hall when I told them who hadarrived they went reluctantly away
Afer a little while Mr Gatz opened the door and cameout his mouth ajar his face fushed slightly his eyes leak-ing isolated and unpunctual tears He had reached an agewhere death no longer has the quality of ghastly surpriseand when he looked around him now for the frst time andsaw the height and splendor of the hall and the great roomsopening out from it into other rooms his grief began to bemixed with an awed pride I helped him to a bedroom up-stairs while he took of his coat and vest I told him that allarrangements had been deferred until he came I didn t know what you d want Mr Gatsby    Gatz is my name
Mr Gatz I thought you might want to take the bodywest
He shook his head
Jimmy always liked it better down East He rose up to hisposition in the East Were you a friend of my boy s Mr   We were close friends
He had a big future before him you know He was only ayoung man but he had a lot of brain power here He touched his head impressively and I nodded If he d of lived he d of been a great man A man likeJames J Hill He d of helped build up the country  Tat s true  I said uncomfortably
He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet trying to take itFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1from the bed and lay down stify was instantly asleepTat night an obviously frightened person called upand demanded to know who I was before he would give hisname
Tis is Mr Carraway  I said
Oh   He sounded relieved  Tis is Klipspringer I was relieved too for that seemed to promise anotherfriend at Gatsby s grave I didn t want it to be in the papersand draw a sightseeing crowd so I d been calling up a fewpeople myself Tey were hard to fnd
Te funeral s tomorrow  I said  Tree o clock here atthe house I wish you d tell anybody who d be interested  Oh I will  he broke out hastily  Of course I m not likelyto see anybody but if I do
His tone made me suspicious
Of course you ll be there yourself
Well I ll certainly try What I called up about is    Wait a minute  I interrupted  How about saying you llcome
Well the fact is the truth of the matter is that I m stay-ing with some people up here in Greenwich and they ratherexpect me to be with them tomorrow In fact there s a sortof picnic or something Of course I ll do my very best to getaway
I ejaculated an unrestrained  Huh  and he must haveheard me for he went on nervously
What I called up about was a pair of shoes I lef there Iwonder if it d be too much trouble to have the butler sendthem on You see they re tennis shoes and I m sort of help-10    The Great Gatsbyless without them My address is care of B F   I didn t hear the rest of the name because I hung up thereceiver
Afer that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby one gentle-man to whom I telephoned implied that he had got whathe deserved However that was my fault for he was one ofthose who used to sneer most bitterly at Gatsby on the cour-age of Gatsby s liquor and I should have known better thanto call him
Te morning of the funeral I went up to New York to seeMeyer Wolfshiem I couldn t seem to reach him any otherway Te door that I pushed open on the advice of an eleva-tor boy was marked  Te Swastika Holding Company  andat frst there didn t seem to be any one inside But when I dshouted  Hello  several times in vain an argument broke outbehind a partition and presently a lovely Jewess appearedat an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostileeyes
Nobody s in  she said  Mr Wolfshiem s gone to Chica-go
Te frst part of this was obviously untrue for someonehad begun to whistle  Te Rosary  tunelessly inside Please say that Mr Carraway wants to see him  I can t get him back from Chicago can I
At this moment a voice unmistakably Wolfshiem s called Stella  from the other side of the door
Leave your name on the desk  she said quickly  I ll giveit to him when he gets back
But I know he s there
Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    11  She took a step toward me and began to slide her handsindignantly up and down her hips
You young men think you can force your way in here anytime  she scolded  We re getting sickantired of it When Isay he s in Chicago he s in ChiCAgo
I mentioned Gatsby
Oh h  She looked at me over again  Will you just what was your name
She vanished In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood sol-emnly in the doorway holding out both hands He drew meinto his ofce remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sadtime for all of us and ofered me a cigar
My memory goes back to when I frst met him  he said A young major just out of the army and covered over withmedals he got in the war He was so hard up he had to keepon wearing his uniform because he couldn t buy some reg-ular clothes First time I saw him was when he come intoWinebrenner s poolroom at Forty-third Street and askedfor a job He hadn t eat anything for a couple of days  Comeon have some lunch with me  I sid He ate more than fourdollars  worth of food in half an hour
Did you start him in business  I inquired
Start him I made him
Oh
I raised him up out of nothing right out of the gutter Isaw right away he was a fne appearing gentlemanly youngman and when he told me he was an Oggsford I knew Icould use him good I got him to join up in the AmericanLegion and he used to stand high there Right of he did1    The Great Gatsbysome work for a client of mine up to Albany We were sothick like that in everything   He held up two bulbous fn-gers   always together
I wondered if this partnership had included the World sSeries transaction in 1919
Now he s dead  I said afer a moment  You were hisclosest friend so I know you ll want to come to his funeralthis afernoon
I d like to come
Well come then
Te hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shookhis head his eyes flled with tears
I can t do it I can t get mixed up in it  he said Tere s nothing to get mixed up in It s all over now  When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up init in any way I keep out When I was a young man it wasdiferent if a friend of mine died no matter how I stuckwith them to the end You may think that s sentimental butI mean it to the bitter end
I saw that for some reason of his own he was determinednot to come so I stood up
Are you a college man  he inquired suddenlyFor a moment I thought he was going to suggest a  gon-negtion  but he only nodded and shook my hand Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he isalive and not afer he is dead  he suggested  Afer that myown rule is to let everything alone
When I lef his ofce the sky had turned dark and I gotback to West Egg in a drizzle Afer changing my clothes IFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1went next door and found Mr Gatz walking up and downexcitedly in the hall His pride in his son and in his son spossessions was continually increasing and now he hadsomething to show me
Jimmy sent me this picture  He took out his wallet withtrembling fngers  Look there
It was a photograph of the house cracked in the cornersand dirty with many hands He pointed out every detail tome eagerly  Look there  and then sought admiration frommy eyes He had shown it so ofen that I think it was morereal to him now than the house itself
Jimmy sent it to me I think it s a very pretty picture Itshows up well
Very well Had you seen him lately
He come out to see me two years ago and bought me thehouse I live in now Of course we was broke up when he runof from home but I see now there was a reason for it Heknew he had a big future in front of him And ever since hemade a success he was very generous with me
He seemed reluctant to put away the picture held it foranother minute lingeringly before my eyes Ten he re-turned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged oldcopy of a book called  Hopalong Cassidy
Look here this is a book he had when he was a boy Itjust shows you

Jimmy was bound to get ahead He always had some re-solves like this or something Do you notice what he s gotabout improving his mind He was always great for that Hetold me I et like a hog once and I beat him for it He was reluctant to close the book reading each itemaloud and then looking eagerly at me I think he rather ex-pected me to copy down the list for my own useA little before three the Lutheran minister arrived fromFlushing and I began to look involuntarily out the windowsfor other cars So did Gatsby s father And as the time passedFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall hiseyes began to blink anxiously and he spoke of the rain in aworried uncertain way Te minister glanced several timesat his watch so I took him aside and asked him to wait forhalf an hour But it wasn t any use Nobody cameAbout fve o clock our procession of three cars reachedthe cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside thegate frst a motor hearse horribly black and wet then MrGatz and the minister and I in the limousine and a littlelater four or fve servants and the postman from West Eggin Gatsby s station wagon all wet to the skin As we startedthrough the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop andthen the sound of someone splashing afer us over the sog-gy ground I looked around It was the man with owl-eyedglasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby s booksin the library one night three months before
I d never seen him since then I don t know how he knewabout the funeral or even his name Te rain poured downhis thick glasses and he took them of and wiped them to seethe protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby s graveI tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment but hewas already too far away and I could only remember with-out resentment that Daisy hadn t sent a message or a fowerDimly I heard someone murmur  Blessed are the dead thatthe rain falls on  and then the owl-eyed man said  Amen tothat  in a brave voice
We straggled down quickly through the rain to the carsOwl-Eyes spoke to me by the gate
I couldn t get to the house  he remarked
1    The Great Gatsby   Neither could anybody else
Go on  He started  Why my God they used to go thereby the hundreds
He took of his glasses and wiped them again outside andin
Te poor son-of-a-bitch  he said
One of my most vivid memories is of coming back westfrom prep school and later from college at Christmas timeTose who went farther than Chicago would gather in theold dim Union Station at six o clock of a December eveningwith a few Chicago friends already caught up into their ownholiday gayeties to bid them a hasty goodbye I remember thefur coats of the girls returning from Miss Tis or Tat s andthe chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overheadas we caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchingsof invitations  Are you going to the Ordways  the Herseys the Schultzes   and the long green tickets clasped tight inour gloved hands And last the murky yellow cars of theChicago Milwaukee and St Paul Railroad looking cheerfulas Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gateWhen we pulled out into the winter night and the realsnow our snow began to stretch out beside us and twinkleagainst the windows and the dim lights of small Wisconsinstations moved by a sharp wild brace came suddenly intothe air We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked backfrom dinner through the cold vestibules unutterably awareof our identity with this country for one strange hour beforewe melted indistinguishably into it again
Tat s my middle west not the wheat or the prairies orFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1the lost Swede towns but the thrilling returning trains ofmy youth and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frostydark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lightedwindows on the snow I am part of that a little solemn withthe feel of those long winters a little complacent from grow-ing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings arestill called through decades by a family s name I see nowthat this has been a story of the West afer all Tom andGatsby Daisy and Jordan and I were all Westerners andperhaps we possessed some defciency in common whichmade us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life
Even when the East excited me most even when I wasmost keenly aware of its superiority to the bored sprawlingswollen towns beyond the Ohio with their interminableinquisitions which spared only the children and the veryold even then it had always for me a quality of distor-tion West Egg especially still fgures in my more fantasticdreams I see it as a night scene by El Greco a hundredhouses at once conventional and grotesque crouchingunder a sullen overhanging sky and a lustreless moon Inthe foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walkingalong the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunkenwoman in a white evening dress Her hand which danglesover the side sparkles cold with jewels Gravely the menturn in at a house the wrong house But no one knows thewoman s name and no one cares
Afer Gatsby s death the East was haunted for me likethat distorted beyond my eyes  power of correction Sowhen the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and1    The Great Gatsbythe wind blew the wet laundry stif on the line I decided tocome back home
Tere was one thing to be done before I lef an awk-ward unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have beenlet alone But I wanted to leave things in order and not justtrust that obliging and indiferent sea to sweep my refuseaway I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around whathad happened to us together and what had happened af-terward to me and she lay perfectly still listening in a bigchair
She was dressed to play golf and I remember thinkingshe looked like a good illustration her chin raised a littlejauntily her hair the color of an autumn leaf her face thesame brown tint as the fngerless glove on her knee WhenI had fnished she told me without comment that she wasengaged to another man I doubted that though there wereseveral she could have married at a nod of her head but Ipretended to be surprised For just a minute I wondered ifI wasn t making a mistake then I thought it all over againquickly and got up to say goodbye
Nevertheless you did throw me over  said Jordan sud-denly  You threw me over on the telephone I don t give adamn about you now but it was a new experience for meand I felt a little dizzy for a while
We shook hands
Oh and do you remember   she added    a conver-sation we had once about driving a car
Why not exactly
You said a bad driver was only safe until she met an-Free eBooks at Planet eBookcom    1other bad driver Well I met another bad driver didn t II mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess Ithought you were rather an honest straightforward personI thought it was your secret pride
I m thirty  I said  I m fve years too old to lie to myselfand call it honor
She didn t answer Angry and half in love with her andtremendously sorry I turned away
One afernoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan Hewas walking ahead of me along Fifh Avenue in his alertaggressive way his hands out a little from his body as if tofght of interference his head moving sharply here andthere adapting itself to his restless eyes Just as I slowed upto avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowninginto the windows of a jewelry store Suddenly he saw meand walked back holding out his hand
What s the matter Nick Do you object to shaking handswith me
Yes You know what I think of you
You re crazy Nick  he said quickly  Crazy as hell I don tknow what s the matter with you
Tom  I inquired  what did you say to Wilson that af-ternoon
He stared at me without a word and I knew I had guessedright about those missing hours I started to turn away buthe took a step afer me and grabbed my arm
I told him the truth  he said  He came to the door whilewe were getting ready to leave and when I sent down wordthat we weren t in he tried to force his way upstairs He was10    The Great Gatsbycrazy enough to kill me if I hadn t told him who owned thecar His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minutehe was in the house    He broke of defantly  What if Idid tell him Tat fellow had it coming to him He threwdust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy s but he was atough one He ran over Myrtle like you d run over a dog andnever even stopped his car
Tere was nothing I could say except the one unutter-able fact that it wasn t true
And if you think I didn t have my share of sufering look here when I went to give up that fat and saw thatdamn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard I satdown and cried like a baby By God it was awful   I couldn t forgive him or like him but I saw that whathe had done was to him entirely justifed It was all verycareless and confused Tey were careless people Tom andDaisy they smashed up things and creatures and then re-treated back into their money or their vast carelessness orwhatever it was that kept them together and let other peo-ple clean up the mess they had made 
I shook hands with him it seemed silly not to for I feltsuddenly as though I were talking to a child Ten he wentinto the jewelry store to buy a pearl necklace or perhapsonly a pair of cuf buttons rid of my provincial squea-mishness forever
Gatsby s house was still empty when I lef the grass onhis lawn had grown as long as mine One of the taxi driv-ers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gatewithout stopping for a minute and pointing inside perhapsFree eBooks at Planet eBookcom    11it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg thenight of the accident and perhaps he had made a story aboutit all his own I didn t want to hear it and I avoided himwhen I got of the train
I spent my Saturday nights in New York because thosegleaming dazzling parties of his were with me so vividlythat I could still hear the music and the laughter faint andincessant from his garden and the cars going up and downhis drive One night I did hear a material car there and sawits lights stop at his front steps But I didn t investigateProbably it was some fnal guest who had been away at theends of the earth and didn t know that the party was overOn the last night with my trunk packed and my car soldto the grocer I went over and looked at that huge incoherentfailure of a house once more On the white steps an obsceneword scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick stood outclearly in the moonlight and I erased it drawing my shoeraspingly along the stone Ten I wandered down to thebeach and sprawled out on the sand
Most of the big shore places were closed now and therewere hardly any lights except the shadowy moving glow ofa ferryboat across the Sound And as the moon rose higherthe inessential houses began to melt away until gradually Ibecame aware of the old island here that fowered once forDutch sailors  eyes a fresh green breast of the new worldIts vanished trees the trees that had made way for Gats-by s house had once pandered in whispers to the last andgreatest of all human dreams for a transitory enchantedmoment man must have held his breath in the presence of1    The Great Gatsbythis continent compelled into an aesthetic contemplationhe neither understood nor desired face to face for the lasttime in history with something commensurate to his capac-ity for wonder
And as I sat there brooding on the old unknown worldI thought of Gatsby s wonder when he frst picked out thegreen light at the end of Daisy s dock He had come a longway to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed soclose that he could hardly fail to grasp it He did not knowthat it was already behind him somewhere back in that vastobscurity beyond the city where the dark felds of the re-public rolled on under the night
Gatsby believed in the green light the orgastic futurethat year by year recedes before us It eluded us then butthat s no matter tomorrow we will run faster stretch outour arms farther  And one fne morning  So we beat on boats against the current borne backceaselessly into the past
